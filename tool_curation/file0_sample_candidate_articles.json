        "a": "Objective: Among intravesical instillation protocol in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), chemotherapy agents have been widely used during the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) shortage era since the patient might under the risk of BCG discontinuation. This study evaluates the efficacy of incomplete BCG instillation compared with pure chemotherapy instillation protocol. Materials and Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC who received incomplete BCG intravesical instillation or chemotherapy instillation were retrospectively included. Patients were divided into three groups according to different intravesical instillation schedules: [BCG only], [BCG + Chemo], and [Chemo only]. Comparisons between these three groups were performed. Bladder recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed as the primary endpoint. Results: A total of 475 patients who received intravesical instillations were enrolled. Compared to the [Chemo only] group, the [BCG + Chemo] group had significantly better bladder RFS (p = 0.027). Multivariate analysis of recurrence revealed the [BCG + Chemo] regimen has a hazard ratio 0.381 (95% CI 0.154-0.941, p = 0.037). The total instillation number >12 was associated with better RFS (p = 0.001) compared with other instillation numbers. Conclusion: For NMIBC patients facing the risk of unexpected BCG instillation interruption, instead of starting instillation with chemotherapy agents, receiving BCG first till stoppage then shifting to chemotherapy agents is recommended.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Leukotriene receptor antagonists including montelukast are an option for step-down therapy for mild asthmatics controlled on low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Because some patients fail montelukast step-down therapy, it would be helpful for clinicians to be able to predict the risk of treatment failure. OBJECTIVES: To determine patient characteristics associated with montelukast treatment failure and develop a clinical index to predict the risk of montelukast treatment failure. METHODS: Using the 165 participants in the Leukotriene or Corticosteroid or Corticosteroid-Salmeterol Study (LOCCS) trial who were stepped down from low-dose ICS to montelukast, we determined associations between enrollment variables and treatment failure. We constructed a montelukast failure index to predict the risk of montelukast treatment failure during step-down. To assess its specificity for montelukast, index performance was evaluated in the other LOCCS treatment groups. RESULTS: Characteristics independently associated with montelukast treatment failure included age of asthma onset <10 years old (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.17-5.02; p = .018), need for steroid burst in the last year (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.13-5.09; p = .022), and pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) (OR = 1.44 per 10% lower % predicted; 95% CI = 1.07-1.97; p = .016). A montelukast failure index was generated from these three variables (range: -5 to 7 points). Scores <0 predicted low risk (<0.20) of treatment failure, whereas scores >5 predicted high risk (>0.60) of treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Early asthma onset, worse asthma control in the last year, and lower pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) are associated with montelukast treatment failure. A montelukast failure index is proposed to quantify the risk of failure prior to treatment initiation.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Information regarding the use of aspirin for patients with no known cardiovascular disease remains conflicting. We performed an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing aspirin with placebos or no treatment published up until November 1, 2018. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause death. The secondary endpoints included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The safety endpoints included major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. Aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction than placebo use or no treatment (risk ratio [RR], 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.95, P = 0.005). Additionally, compared with the control groups, aspirin use was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. In terms of safety, aspirin use was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (RR, 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25-1.57, P = 0.000), gastrointestinal bleeding (RR, 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25-1.99, P = 0.000), and hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 1.30, 95% CI: 1.06-1.60, P = 0.011). Furthermore, the treatment effect was not significantly modified by patients' clinical characteristics. No publication bias was present. CONCLUSION: Aspirin use reduced the myocardial infarction risk in patients without known cardiovascular disease, but had no effect in terms of reducing the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and stroke, and increased the risk of major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke.",

It is valuable to consider the combined use of predictive toxicological assessment supported by deliberate investigation on aspects such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicokinetic profiles, the risk that may be introduced during nanomanufacture, unique nanomaterials properties, and nonobvious nanosafety endpoints, for example. These efforts will allow the generation of investigational new drug-enabling safety data that can be incorporated into a rational infrastructure for regulatory decision-making.

        "a": "Several angiographic adverse events during coronary balloon angioplasty have been associated with increased creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) enzymes and adverse clinical outcomes. The significance of angiographic adverse events in the stent era has not been widely studied. We analyzed 10 types of angiographic adverse events that were reported in the 6,010-patient Second Randomized Evaluation in PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events (REPLACE-2) trial to determine their relation to CK-MB elevation and clinical ischemic end points after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Angiographic adverse events occurred in 9.1% of REPLACE-2 patients. Most (8 of 10) types of angiographic adverse events were associated with an increased risk of increased CK-MB (p <0.001 for each), and 47% of all patients with an angiographic adverse event developed increased CK-MB. Logistic regression analysis showed that the strongest predictor of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 6 months was the occurrence of an angiographic adverse event during PCI (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.4, p <0.001). Side branch closure, abrupt closure, any decreased flow during the procedure, angiographic distal embolization, and perforation or tamponade were individual predictors of the occurrence of the combined clinical ischemic end point at 6-month follow-up (p <0.005 for each). In conclusion, most angiographic adverse events during PCI are associated with increased CK-MB and are powerful predictors of adverse clinical events within 6 months.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: We linked extensive longitudinal data from the Swedish national eating disorders quality registers and patient registers to explore clinical characteristics at diagnosis, diagnostic flux, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicide attempts in 850 individuals diagnosed with binge-eating disorder (BED). METHOD: Cases were all individuals who met criteria for BED in the quality registers (N\u2009=\u2009850). We identified 10 controls for each identified case from the Multi-Generation Register matched on sex, and year, month, and county of birth. We evaluated characteristics of individuals with BED at evaluation and explored diagnostic flux across eating disorders presentations between evaluation and one-year follow-up. We applied conditional logistic regression models to assess the association of BED with each comorbid psychiatric disorder and with suicide attempts and explored whether risk for depression and suicide were differentially elevated in individuals with BED with or without comorbid obesity. RESULTS: BED shows considerable diagnostic flux with other eating disorders over time, carries high psychiatric comorbidity burden with other eating disorders (OR 85.8; 95\u00a0% CI: 61.6, 119.4), major depressive disorder (OR 7.6; 95\u00a0% CI: 6.2, 9.3), bipolar disorder (OR 7.5; 95\u00a0% CI: 4.8, 11.9), anxiety disorders (OR 5.2; 95\u00a0% CI: 4.2, 6.4), and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 4.3; 95\u00a0% CI: 3.2, 5.7) and is associated with elevated risk for suicide attempts (OR 1.8; 95\u00a0% CI: 1.2, 2.7). Depression and suicide attempt risk were elevated in individuals with BED with and without comorbid obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable flux occurs across BED and other eating disorder diagnoses. The high psychiatric comorbidity and suicide risk underscore the severity and clinical complexity of BED.",

Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution is a preservative used during organ transplantation. We tested the potential of HTK to protect neurons from severe hypoxia (SH) following CA. We isolated rat primary cortical neurons and induced SH with or without HTK. Changes in caspase-3, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-4 (NOX4) expression were evaluated at different time points up to 72 h. Using a rat asphyxia model, we induced CA-mediated brain damage and then completed resuscitation. HTK or sterile saline was administered into the left carotid artery. Neurological deficit scoring and mortality were evaluated for 3 days. Then the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of NOX4 and H2O2 levels in blood and brain. In the in vitro study, HTK attenuated SH- and H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity in a volume- and time-dependent manner, associated with persistent HIF-1\u03b1 expression and reductions in procaspase-3 activation and NOX4 expression. The inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 abrogated HTK's effect on NOX4. In the in vivo study, neurological scores were significantly improved by HTK. H2O2 level, NOX4 activity, and NOX4 gene expression were all decreased in the brain specimens of HTK-treated rats. Our results suggest that HTK acts as an effective neuroprotective solution by maintaining elevated HIF-1\u03b1 level, which was associated with inhibited procaspase-3 activation and decreased NOX4 expression.",

        "a": "Variable mortality rates have been reported for patients with rheumatic diseases admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the absence of appropriate control groups in previous studies, it is not known whether the presence of a rheumatic disease constitutes a risk factor. Moreover, the accuracy of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score for predicting outcome in this group of patients has been questioned. The primary goal of this study was to compare outcome of patients with rheumatic diseases admitted to a medical ICU to those of controls. The records of all patients admitted between 1 April 2003 and 30 June 2014 (n=4020) were screened for the presence of a rheumatic disease during admission (n=138). The diagnosis of a rheumatic disease was by standard criteria for these conditions. An age- and gender-matched control group of patients without a rheumatic disease was extracted from the patient population in the database during the same period (n=831). Mortality in ICU, in hospital and after 180 days did not differ significantly between patients with and without rheumatic diseases. There was no difference in the performance of the APACHE II score for predicting outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases and controls. This score, as well as a requirement for the use of inotropes or vasopressors, accurately predicted hospital mortality in the group of patients with rheumatic diseases. In conclusion, patients with a rheumatic condition admitted to intensive care do not do significantly worse than patients without such a disease.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is used to manage symptomatic gallstones. There is considerable controversy regarding whether it should be done as day-surgery or as an overnight stay surgery with regards to patient safety. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of day-surgery versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, severe adverse events, and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and mRCT until September 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials comparing day-surgery versus overnight stay surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, irrespective of language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat or available case analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of six trials at high risk of bias involving 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 253) for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150. The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%. The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years.With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-term mortality. However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups. We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short-term mortality in the remaining trials. Long-term mortality was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day-surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). There was no significant difference in quality of life between the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10).There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the secondary outcomes of our review: pain (3 trials; 175 participants; MD 0.02 cm visual analogue scale score; 95% CI -0.69 to 0.73); time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; MD -0.55 days; 95% CI -2.18 to 1.08); and return to work (1 trial, 74 participants; MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -10.34 to 6.34). No significant difference was seen in hospital readmission rate (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 (weighted rate 0.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/239 (2.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group (rate ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63) or in the proportion of people requiring hospital readmissions (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (weighted proportion 3.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/154 (3.2%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60). No significant difference was seen in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the two groups (5 trials; 419 participants; 42/205 (weighted proportion 19.3%) in the day-surgery group versus 43/214 (20.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41). For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required information size to exclude random errors. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Day-surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Day-surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The randomised clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the quality of life as well as other outcomes of patients.",

Although direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) trials excluded patients with severe CKD, a growing portion of CKD patients have been starting DOACs and limited data from real-world outcome in this high-risk setting are available. The INSigHT registry included 632 consecutive NVAF patients that started apixaban (256 patients, 41%), dabigatran (245, 39%) and rivaroxaban (131, 20%) between 2012 and 2015. Based on creatinine clearance, two sub-cohorts were defined: (1) non-CKD group (CrCl 60-89\u00a0mL/min, 413 patients) and (2) CKD group (15-59\u00a0ml/min, 219). Compared to non-CKD patients, those with CKD, were at higher ischemic (CHA2DS2-VASc 4.5 vs 2.9, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and hemorrhagic risk (HAS-BLED 2.4 vs 1.8, p\u2009<\u20090.001). At 2-year follow-up, the overall ISTH-major bleeding and thromboembolic event rates were 5.2% and 2.3% and no significant difference between non-CKD and CKD patients for both efficacy and safety endpoints were observed. In non-CKD patients, the 2-year ISTH-major bleeding rates were higher in rivaroxaban group (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.3; p\u2009=\u20090.047) while dabigatran showed non-significant excess in thromboembolic events (HR 4.3, 95% CI 0.9-20.8; p\u2009=\u20090.068). In CKD patients, a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic events was observed in rivaroxaban (HR 6.3, 95% CI 1.1-38.1; p\u2009=\u20090.044). This real-world, non-insurance database registry shows remarkable 2-year safety and efficacy profile of DOACs even in patients with moderate to severe CKD.

Here, in the independent cohort, we externally validated the predictive performance of the mPAGE-B score and compared it with those of conventional HCC prediction models. METHODS: We consecutively recruited CHB patients treated with lamivudine, entecavir or tenofovir as the first-line antiviral regimen. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Predictive performances of the mPAGE-B score and other models were assessed with comparison. RESULTS: Among 1330 patients, 9.6% developed HCC during follow-up. The mPAGE-B score provided the highest Harrell's c-index (0.769), followed by the GAG-HCC (0.751), PAGE (0.744), REACH-B (0.686) and CU-HCC (0.618) scores. The mPAGE-B score showed the similar performance to the PAGE-B and GAG-HCC scores and the better performance than the REACH-B and CU-HCC scores. Cumulative HCC probabilities at 5- and 7-years were 0.0% and 0.0% in low-risk group (mPAGE-B score\u00a0\u2264\u00a08), 6.1% and 10.8% in intermediate-risk group (mPAGE-B score 9-12) and 18.7% and 26.7% in high-risk group (mPAGE-B score\u00a0\u2265\u00a013) respectively (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 between adjacent two groups). C-indices of the mPAGE-B score were 0.785 and 0.724 among subgroups treated with entecavir or tenofovir (n\u00a0=\u00a01011) and with lamivudine (n\u00a0=\u00a0319), respectively, which are overall similar to those of the PAGE-B score.

In each sub-category, MT could be combined or not with exercise and/or usual medical care. RESULTS: Initially 121 studies were identified for potential inclusion. Based on qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria, 23 RCTs were identified for review. Evidence for ASNP: MODERATE-evidence: In favour of (i) MT1 to the cervical spine (Cx) combined with exercises when compared to MT1 to the thoracic spine (Tx) combined with exercises; (ii) MT3 to the Cx and Tx combined with exercise compared to MT2 to the Cx with exercise or compared to usual medical care for pain and satisfaction with care from short to long-term. Evidence for CNP: STRONG-evidence: Of no difference of efficacy between MT2 at the symptomatic Cx level(s) in comparison to MT2 on asymptomatic Cx level(s) for pain and function. MODERATE to STRONG-evidence: In favour of MT1 and MT3 on Cx and Tx with exercise in comparison to exercise or MT alone for pain, function, satisfaction with care and general-health from short to moderate-terms. MODERATE-evidence: In favour (i) of MT1 as compared to MT2 and MT4, all applied to the Cx, for neck mobility, and pain in the very short term; (ii) of MT2 using sof-tissue-techniques to the Cx and Tx or MT3 to the Cx and Tx in comparison to no-treatment in the short-term for pain and disability. CONCLUSION: This systematic review updates the evidence for MT combined or not with exercise and/or usual medical care for different stages of NP and provides recommendations for future studies. Two majors points could be highlighted, the first one is that combining different forms of MT with exercise is better than MT or exercise alone, and the second one is that mobilization need not be applied at the symptomatic level(s) for improvements of NP patients. These both points may have clinical implications for reducing the risk involved with some MT techniques applied to the cervical spine.",

METHODS: We linked the National Death Index and central cancer registry records independently to the Indian Health Service (IHS) patient registration database to improve identification of AI/AN persons in cancer mortality and incidence data, respectively. Analyses were restricted to non-Hispanic persons residing in Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties in 6 geographic regions of the United States. We compared age-adjusted mortality and incidence rates for AI/AN populations with White populations using rate ratios and mortality-to-incidence ratios. Trends were described using joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Cancer mortality and incidence rates for AI/AN persons compared with Whites varied by region and type of cancer. Trends in death rates showed that greater progress in cancer control was achieved for White populations compared with AI/AN populations over the last 2 decades. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial variations in mortality and incidence by type of cancer demonstrated both persistent and emerging challenges for cancer control in AI/AN populations.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis has high mortality. At present, there is no effective way to cure the patients diagnosed with gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis due to its indistinct molecular mechanism. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis and help for further target therapy, we conduct comprehensive analysis of peritoneal metastasis by bioinformatics in gastric cancer. METHODS: Microarray sequencing was used to find differential mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression between primary foci and peritoneal metastases lesion in gastric cancer. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expression levels of lncRNAs in gastric cancer cells after co-culture with adipocytes. TCGA, Cytoscape, lnCAR, cBioPoratal and R packages (ggrisk, survival, survminer, timeROC, forestplot, immunedeconv, ggplot2, pheatmap and ggpubr) were applied in this work. RESULTS: Adipocytes co-culture model was used to mimic the peritoneal microenvironment and found that LINC01151 (NR_126348), FAM27B (NR_027422) and LINC00924 (NR_027133) were up-regulated in co-culture group. Increased LINC00924 expression was significantly associated with reduced overall survival and up-regulated percentage abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T, B, macrophage and NK immune cells; moreover, immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) had a worse effect on the LINC00924 high expression group. Furthermore, through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we found that LINC00924-related PEX5L in CNC network was an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer progression. CONCLUSION: LINC00924 expression was associated with poor survival, immune infiltrations and worse response to ICBs. LINC00924 might be immunotherapeutic targets of advanced gastric cancer.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Current guidelines suggest the introduction of early nutrition support within the first 48\u00a0h of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients who cannot eat. In that context, we aimed to describe nutrition practices in the ICU and study the association between the introduction of early nutrition support (<\u200948\u00a0h) in the ICU and patient mortality at day 28 (D28) using data from a multicentre prospective cohort. METHODS: The 'French-Speaking ICU Nutritional Survey' (FRANS) study was conducted in 26 ICUs in France and Belgium over 3\u00a0months in 2015. Adult patients with a predicted ICU length of stay\u2009>\u20093\u00a0days were consecutively included and followed for 10\u00a0days. Their mortality was assessed at D28. We investigated the association between early nutrition (<\u200948\u00a0h) and mortality at D28 using univariate and multivariate propensity-score-weighted logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: During the study period, 1206 patients were included. Early nutrition support was administered to 718 patients (59.5%), with 504 patients receiving enteral nutrition and 214 parenteral nutrition. Early nutrition was more frequently prescribed in the presence of multiple organ failure and less frequently in overweight and obese patients. Early nutrition was significantly associated with D28 mortality in the univariate analysis (crude odds ratio (OR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.34) and propensity-weighted multivariate analysis (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10). In subgroup analyses, this association was stronger in patients\u2009\u2264\u200965\u00a0years and with SOFA scores\u2009\u2264\u20098. Compared with no early nutrition, a significant association was found of D28 mortality with early enteral (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) but not early parenteral nutrition (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort study, early nutrition support in the ICU was significantly associated with increased mortality at D28, particularly in younger patients with less severe disease. Compared to no early nutrition, only early enteral nutrition appeared to be associated with increased mortality. Such findings are in contrast with current guidelines on the provision of early nutrition support in the ICU and may challenge our current practices, particularly concerning patients at low nutrition risk.

        "a": "Venous thromboembolism is a frequent clinical condition with high impact on both morbidity and mortality. Venous thromboembolism risk is particularly high in hospitalized patients as well as in oncologic patients, being a factor of poor prognosis for the oncologic disease. Several clinical studies have shown the need to develop effective hospital strategies using a systematic and individualized assessment of venous thromboembolism risk, and additionally to optimize the institution of prophylaxis treatment and its proper use in the context of in-hospital and outpatient management. The ARTE national study is a non-interventional, multicentre, prospective study which is divided in two phases. In the first phase patients are followed in the hospital; in the second phase patients are followed in ambulatory context for a period of 6 months after discharge. Four thousand patients will be included, equally distributed over medical, surgical, oncologic and orthopaedic patients. Data will be collected from the patient's clinical files and through direct clinical evaluation of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, in the departments of medicine, oncology, surgery, and orthopaedics of the participating centres. The main objectives of the study are to assess the risk profile of venous thromboembolism of the study population using a risk assessment model adapted from the Caprini and Khorana et al models, and the validation of the score for the Portuguese population. Simultaneously, the secondary objectives are as follows: to determine the proportion of patients with venous thromboembolism risk, according to the risk assessment model, that are doing prophylaxis; to determine the duration of prophylaxis during the hospitalization; to determine the proportion of patients doing long-term prophylaxis, at the moment of the discharge; to determine the incidence of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis; stroke; pulmonary thromboembolism; transient ischemic attack), haemorrhagic events (major and minor haemorrhages) and death at 6 months after discharge. Each patient will be contacted by telephone at 3 and 6 months after discharge, in order to assess the occurrence of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events, as well as any readmission. This article describes the ARTE study's rationale, objectives, and methodology.",

This retrospective study sought to characterize the rates of proximal aortic dilation in young patients, identify risk factors for TAA progression, and evaluate the predictive utility of early echocardiographic follow-up. Inclusion criteria were: (1) TAA or TAA-predisposing genetic diagnosis, (2) age\u2009<\u200925\u00a0years at first echocardiogram, and (3) minimum of 5\u00a0years of echocardiographic follow-up. Proximal aortic diameters were measured by echocardiography and Z-scores calculated to index for body surface area. TAA severity was classified as no TAA (Z-score\u2009<\u20092), mild (Z-score 2 to 4), or at least moderate (Z-score\u2009>\u20094). Among 141 included patients, mean age at first echocardiogram was 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u00a0years. Mean follow-up duration was 9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u00a0years. Fifty five patients had a genetic syndrome, and 38 of the non-syndromic patients had bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The rate of aortic dilation was significantly higher at the ascending aorta than other aortic segments. BAV and age\u2009>\u200910\u00a0years at first echocardiogram were associated with increased rate of ascending aorta dilation. At the ascending aorta, over 25% of patients had categorical increase in TAA severity between first and last echocardiograms, and such patients demonstrated higher rate of dilation within their first 2\u00a0years of follow-up. These longitudinal findings highlight progressive ascending aorta dilation in young patients, which may worsen around adolescence. This may help determine timing of follow-up and target ages for clinical trials.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether statin treatment before or after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) affects the risk of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), postacute ICH, and mortality within 90 days. METHODS: Data were sought from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive, an international repository of clinical trials data. Using propensity score matching, we retrospectively compared patients with prior statin treatment and newly initiated statin within 3 days after AIS to patients without statin exposure. Outcomes of interest were acute symptomatic ICH (sICH), any acute ICH, postacute ICH, and mortality during follow-up of 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 8,535 patients (mean age 70 years, 54% male, median baseline NIH Stroke Scale score 13) were analyzed. After propensity score matching, prior statin use was not strongly associated with sICH (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.14) or any ICH (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.92-1.98). There was no evidence of an interaction between prior statin use and thrombolysis. New initiation of statins was not associated with postacute ICH (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.60, 95% CI 0.70-3.65). There was a signal towards lower 90-day mortality in patients with prior statin use (adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.00) and especially early initiation of statins (adjusted HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use prior to AIS was not associated with early hemorrhagic complications, irrespective of treatment with thrombolysis. New initiation of statin treatment early after AIS did not affect risk of postacute ICH, but might be associated with reduced mortality.",

A critical point of access associated with youth NUPM is the Internet. Internet use among this vulnerable patient group is ubiquitous and includes new, emerging, and rapidly developing technologies-particularly social media networking (eg, Facebook and Twitter). These unregulated technologies may pose a potential risk for enabling youth NUPM behavior. In order to address limitations of current regulations and promote online safety, we advocate for legislative reform to specifically address NUPM promotion via social media and other new online platforms.

We here generated a genetic risk score system comprised of 12 HCC-specific genes to better predict the prognosis of HCC patients. Four genomics profiling datasets (GSE5851, GSE28691, GSE15765 and GSE14323) were searched to seek HCC-specific genes by comparisons between cancer samples and normal liver tissues and between different subtypes of hepatic neoplasms. Univariate survival analysis screened HCC-specific genes associated with overall survival (OS) in the training dataset for next-step risk model construction. The prognostic value of the constructed HCC risk score system was then validated in the TCGA dataset. Stratified analysis indicated this scoring system showed better performance in elderly male patients with HBV infection and preoperative lower levels of creatinine, alpha-fetoprotein and platelet and higher level of albumin. Functional annotation of this risk model in high-risk patients revealed that pathways associated with cell cycle, cell migration and inflammation were significantly enriched. In summary, our constructed HCC-specific gene risk model demonstrated robustness and potentiality in predicting the prognosis of HCC patients, especially among elderly male patients with HBV infection and relatively better general conditions.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol that used hourly urine output plus the arterial waveform analysis FloTrac (Edwards LifeSciences, Irvine, Calif) system for major burns to avoid fluid overload. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 43 major burn patients at the Tri-Service General Hospital after the Formosa Fun Coast Dust Explosion on June 27, 2015. Because of the limited capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), 23 intubated patients were transferred from the burn wards or emergency department to the ICU within 24 hours. Fluid administration was adjusted to achieve a urine output of 30 to 50 mL/h, cardiac index greater than 2.5 L/min/m, and stroke volume variation (SVV) less than 12%. The hourly crystalloid fluid infusion rate was titrated based on SVV and hourly urine output. RESULTS: Of the 23 critically burned patients admitted to the ICU, 13 patients who followed the goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol within 12 hours postburn were included in the analysis. The mean age (years) was 21.8, and the mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned (%) was 68.0. The mean Revised Baux score was 106.8. All patients sustained inhalation injury. The fluid volumes administered to patients in the first 24 hours and the second 24 hours (mL/kg/% total body surface area) were 3.62 \u00b1 1.23 and 2.89 \u00b1 0.79, respectively. The urine outputs in the first 24 hours and the second 24 hours (mL/kg/h) were 1.13 \u00b1 0.66 and 1.53 \u00b1 0.87, respectively. All patients achieved the established goals within 32 hours postburn. In-hospital mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS: The SVV-based goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol leads to less unnecessary fluid administration during the early resuscitation phase.

        "a": "PURPOSE: To study the effects of a perindopril-based regimen on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with vascular disease in relation to background statin therapy. METHODS: A pooled analysis of the randomized ADVANCE, EUROPA, and PROGRESS trials was performed to evaluate CV outcomes in 29,463 patients with vascular disease treated with perindopril-based regimens versus placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of CV mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the effects of a perindopril-based regimen versus placebo in relation to statin use. RESULTS: At randomization, 39.5% of the overall combined study population used statins. After a mean follow-up of 4.0\u00a0years (SD 1.0), the cumulative event-free survival was highest in the statin/perindopril group and lowest in the no statin/placebo group (91.2% vs. 85.6%, respectively, log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.001). In statin users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.98) and non-statin users (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87), a perindopril-based regimen was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary endpoint when compared to placebo. The additional treatment effect appeared numerically greater in non-statin users, but the observed difference was statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the treatment benefits of a perindopril-based regimen in patients with vascular disease are independent of statin use.",

METHODS: The research team performed a systematic search in PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science without language or date restrictions. Full-text reports on prospective diagnostic studies involve the detection of lower-limb proximal and distal DVT in patients without symptoms of DVT using US and venography. A meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc (version 1.4), providing the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios of the detection accuracy of US. There were 4 different classes of subgroup analysis-the class of patients stratified by location of US exam (proximal, distal, whole leg), the class stratified by technique (color/doppler, compression, both modalities), the class stratified by kind of surgery (orthopedic, otherwise hospitalized) and the class stratified by era of publishing (1980s, 1990s, 2000s). The study quality and the risk of bias were evaluated using QUADAS-2, with heterogeneity was assessed and quantified by the Q score and I statistics, respectively. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 26 articles containing 41 individual studies with a total of 3951 patients without symptoms of DVT. Using venography as the gold standard, US for proximal DVT had a pooled sensitivity of 59% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 51%-66%) and a pooled specificity of 98% (95% CI = 97%-98%), US for distal DVT had a poor sensitivity of 43% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a38%-48%) and a pooled specificity of 95% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a94%-96%), US for whole-leg DVT had a pooled sensitivity of 59% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a54%-64%) and a pooled specificity of 95% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a94%-96%), US for post-major orthopedic surgery patients had a pooled sensitivity of 52% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a49%-55%), and US for other types of patients had a pooled sensitivity of 58% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a43%-72%). Pure compression technique for DVT had a poor sensitivity of 43% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a39%-48%), pure color/doppler technique for DVT had a pooled sensitivity of 58% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a53%-63%), compression and color/doppler technique for DVT had a pooled sensitivity of 61% (95% CI\u200a=\u200a48%-74%). CONCLUSION: US could be a useful tool for diagnosing DVT, but it has a lower positive rate and a higher false negative rate. The rate of missed diagnosis of lower-limb DVT by US amounts to 50% or so in the patients without symptoms of DVT. The negative results do not preclude the possibility of DVT and if appropriate heightened surveillance and continued monitoring or try a more accurate inspection method is warranted. The whole leg evaluation and color/doppler technique should be the preferred approach.",

In this study, we compared major intraoperative surgical complications of resident-performed phacoemulsification surgeries between cases with low intraoperative risk and random cases with unknown intraoperative risk. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study was done on patients who underwent phacoemulsification surgery by third- and fourth-year residents in Khatam-al-Anbia eye hospital, Mashhad, Iran. Preoperative risk was calculated using Najjar-Awwad risk score after slit lamp examination and the patients with scores 7 or higher were considered high-risk. Patients were randomly assigned into a study group, in which only low-risk cases were operated by third-year residents, or control group, in which third-year residents were able to operate any patient regardless of the risk score. In both groups, the remaining patients were operated by fourth-year residents. All intraoperative complications were recorded. Data were analyzed using SPSS, considering P<0.05 significant. RESULTS: Overall, 475 patients with cataract in the study (N=232) and control (N=243) groups were operated. Mean overall Najjar-Awwad risk scores did not differ significantly between the groups, but pseudoexfoliation and poor pupil dilatation occurred significantly more frequently in the control group (P=0.010 and P=0.014, respectively). Overall, 36 surgeries in the study group (15.5%) and 47 surgeries in the control group (19.3%) were complicated (P=0.273). There was a significant difference between the third- and fourth-year residents regarding the inability to complete continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (P=0.033). The risk of overall and major complications in high-risk cases was significantly higher among those operated by 3rd-year residents compared with those operated by 4th-year residents (OR=3.45, 95% CI=1.2-9.9, P=0.016 and OR=6.37, 95% CI=1.99-20.34, P=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although supervised resident-performed phacoemulsification has a relatively safe learning curve in our residency program, it is best to stratify preoperative risk and assign high-risk cases to senior residents with higher experience.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: EPC number and functionality are assumed to reflect the endogenous vascular repair capacity with the EPC pool declining in higher ages and being exhausted by unfavorable life-style and risk factors. This intriguing and clinically highly relevant concept, however, has so far been derived from small case-control studies and patient series. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In the population-based Bruneck Study EPC number and EPC-colony forming units (EPC-CFU) were assessed as part of the fourth follow-up evaluation (2005) in 571 and 542 subjects, respectively. EPC number declined with age (p = 0.013), was significantly lower in women (p = 0.006) and higher in subjects on statin, hormone replacement or ACE inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blockers, and correlated positively with moderate alcohol consumption. Unexpectedly, a positive relation between EPC number and several vascular risk factors emerged. In a step forward multivariate linear regression analysis EPC number was independently related with SDF1alpha, MMP-9, triglycerides, alcohol consumption, and Hba1c. EPC-CFU in turn was related to SDF1alpha and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, EPC number showed a significant positive association with the Framingham risk score (P = 0.001). Finally, there was an inverse association between EPC number and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (p = 0.02) and the carotid artery atherosclerosis score (p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based data confirm the decline of EPC number with advancing age and lend first epidemiological support to a role of SDF-1alpha and MMP9 in EPC differentiation, mobilization and homing, but are conflict with the view that EPC number is unfavorably affected by cardiovascular risk factors. EPC number increases with the cardiovascular risk estimated by the Framingham risk score (FRS), which in the absence of similar changes for EPC-CFU. Finally, we demonstrate a significant inverse association between EPC number and extent of carotid atherosclerosis even though this association was only of moderate strength and not entirely consistent in other vascular territories.",

        "a": "Objective: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) after percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PTED) surgery may be caused by preoperative lumbar microinstability (MI). However, there is a paucity of research on the relationship between lumbar microinstability and chronic low back pain. The purpose of this article is to assess the preoperative radiographic characteristics of patients and evaluate the effects of lumbar microinstability on patient-reported outcomes among single-level lumbar disc herniation (LDH) patients who underwent PTED. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the radiographic characteristics of a consecutive series of 127 patients with low back pain and leg pain caused by single-level LDH underwent PTED from August 2018 to March 2021. They were divided into three groups according to the radiographic parameters: the stable group (Group S), the dysfunctional group (Group D), and the microinstability group (Group M). The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for leg and low back pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for CLBP. Results: Compared with Group D and Group S, Group M had the highest ODI scores (P < 0.01) and VAS scores (low back pain) (P < 0.01) after 1 year, while there were no significant differences in the VAS scores for leg pain at different time points after surgery (P > 0.05). In addition, the logistic regression analysis results regarding CLBP revealed that muscle fatty degeneration on MRI (95% CI, 1.20-8.51, P = 0.02), and facet tropism (95% CI, 1.39 -11.37, P = 0.01) may be independent risk factors. Conclusion: Patients with lumbar microinstability may have CLBP after PTED, so patients with lumbar microinstability may need to take internal fixation surgery to solve their symptoms.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Using the EORTC Global Health Status (GHS) scale, we aimed to determine minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) changes for older cancer patients with a geriatric risk profile, as defined by the geriatric 8 (G8) health screening tool, undergoing treatment. Simultaneously, we assessed baseline patient characteristics prognostic for HRQOL changes. METHODS: Our analysis included 1424 (G8\u2009\u2264\u200914) older patients with cancer scheduled to receive chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u2009683) or surgery (n\u2009=\u2009741). Anchor-based methods, linking the GHS score to clinical indicators, were used to determine MCID between baseline and follow-up at 3\u00a0months. A threshold of 0.2 standard deviation (SD) was used to exclude MCID estimates too small for interpretation. Logistic regressions analysed baseline patient characteristics prognostic for HRQOL changes. RESULTS: The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Fatigue and ECOG Performance Status (PS) were selected as clinical anchors. In the surgery group, MCID estimates for improvement and deterioration were ECOG PS (5*, 11*), GDS15 (5*, 2) and VAS Fatigue (3, 9*). In the chemotherapy group, MCID estimates for improvement and deterioration were ECOG PS (8*, 7*), GDS15 (5, 4) and VAS Fatigue (5, 5*). Estimates with * were >\u20090.2 SD threshold. Patients experiencing pain or malnutrition (surgery group) or fatigue (chemotherapy group) at baseline showed a significantly stable or improved HRQOL (p\u2009<\u20090.05) after their treatment. CONCLUSION: The reported MCID for improvement and deterioration depended on the anchor used and treatment received. The estimates can be used to evaluate significant changes in HRQOL and to determine sample sizes in clinical trials.",

METHODS: Sensitivity, specificity, correct outcome prediction, and discrimination were assessed in 43 patients in the war group (ballistic injuries) and 41 patients in the civil group (nonballistic injuries) during the period 1991 to 1995. The new model was generated using the sum of GCS scores and ISS, to which a coded value was applied for summation. RESULTS: In the war group, the mortality rate was 23%; the sensitivity and specificity of WHIS were 100% and 79%, the sensitivity and specificity of GCS score were 90% and 85%, and the sensitivity and specificity of ISS were 100% and 49%, respectively. In the civil group, the mortality rate was 39%; the sensitivity and specificity of WHIS were 87% and 76%, the sensitivity and specificity of GCS score were 63% and 90%, and the sensitivity and specificity of ISS were 100% and 56%, respectively.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: To explore the impact of intrapericardial and infracardiac drains on pericardial effusions in cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized into two groups. At the end of the intervention, an intrapericardial and infracardiac Blake drain was placed in patients in group 1 (n = 97), and an intrapericardial and infracardiac semirigid drain was placed in patients in group 2 (n = 105). In addition, a semirigid drain was placed into mediastinum in all cases. The amount of drainage was calculated at six different time points postoperatively: postoperative 0 to 2 h, postoperative 2 to 4 h, postoperative 4 to 6 h, postoperative 6 to 12 h, postoperative 12 to 24 h, and postoperative 24 to 48 h. The amount of pericardial effusion was estimated by transthoracic echocardiography after the drains were removed. RESULTS: In all measurements, the amount of drainage from intrapericardial Blake drains was higher, the total amount of drainage being equal to 330.7 +/- 29.4 mL and 193.2 +/- 19.6 mL in the Blake drain and semirigid drain groups, respectively (p = 0.000) [mean +/- SD]. When the drains were removed, the volume of pericardial effusion was 3.86 +/- 0.76 mm in Blake drain group and 7.59 +/- 1.16 mm in semirigid drain group (p = 0.000). The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 11.3% in the group with Blake drains, and 23.8% in the group with semirigid drains (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The more effective drainage obtained with infracardiac Blake drains compared to semirigid drains helps to reduce the amount of postoperative pericardial effusion and the risk of atrial fibrillation.",

Paliperidone palmitate (PAL) and aripiprazole monohydrate (ARI) LAI treatments were associated with improvements in global functioning in patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the predictive factors of better overall functioning in patients with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder treated with PAL and ARI. METHOD: Enrolled were 143 (97 males, 46 females, mean age 38.24\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a012.65) patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, whom we allocated in two groups (PAL and ARI treatments). We assessed global functioning, amount of oral medications, adherence to oral treatment, and number of hospitalisations before LAI introduction and at assessment time point. RESULTS: Longer treatment time with LAIs (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), lower number of oral drugs (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and hospitalisations (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) before LAI introduction, and shorter duration of illness (p\u00a0=\u00a0.038) predicted better Global Assessment of Functioning scores in the whole sample (R2 \u00a0=\u00a00.337). CONCLUSION: Early administration and longer duration of ARI or PAL treatments could play a significant role in improving global functioning of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Better improvement in functioning could be achieved with ARI in young individuals with recent illness onset and PAL in patients at risk for recurrent hospitalisations.",

        "a": "CONTEXT: Children with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis are routinely admitted to the hospital and treated with parenteral antibiotics, although few have bacterial meningitis. We previously developed a clinical prediction rule, the Bacterial Meningitis Score, that classifies patients at very low risk of bacterial meningitis if they lack all of the following criteria: positive CSF Gram stain, CSF absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 1000 cells/microL, CSF protein of at least 80 mg/dL, peripheral blood ANC of at least 10,000 cells/microL, and a history of seizure before or at the time of presentation. OBJECTIVE: To validate the Bacterial Meningitis Score in the era of widespread pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study conducted in emergency departments of 20 US academic medical centers through the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Collaborative Research Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics. All children aged 29 days to 19 years who presented at participating emergency departments between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2004, with CSF pleocytosis (CSF white blood cells > or =10 cells/microL) and who had not received antibiotic treatment before lumbar puncture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the Bacterial Meningitis Score. RESULTS: Among 3295 patients with CSF pleocytosis, 121 (3.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-4.4%) had bacterial meningitis and 3174 (96.3%; 95% CI, 95.5%-96.9%) had aseptic meningitis. Of the 1714 patients categorized as very low risk for bacterial meningitis by the Bacterial Meningitis Score, only 2 had bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 98.3%; 95% CI, 94.2%-99.8%; negative predictive value, 99.9%; 95% CI, 99.6%-100%), and both were younger than 2 months old. A total of 2518 patients (80%) with aseptic meningitis were hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: This large multicenter study validates the Bacterial Meningitis Score prediction rule in the era of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine as an accurate decision support tool. The risk of bacterial meningitis is very low (0.1%) in patients with none of the criteria. The Bacterial Meningitis Score may be helpful to guide clinical decision making for the management of children presenting to emergency departments with CSF pleocytosis.",

        "a": "Background Surgical site infections can have a significant impact on cardiac surgical outcome. The liver plays an important role in infection prevention. This study aimed to retrospectively determine whether transient postoperative liver dysfunction after coronary bypass surgery increased surgical site infections. Methods A modified version of the Schindl scoring scale for liver dysfunction was adapted to objectively quantify transient liver dysfunction in the first 7 days after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. A retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes at 30 months postoperatively was performed on data of 575 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass between 2014 and 2016. The patients were categorized into a liver dysfunction group (Schindl score\u2009\u2265\u20094) and a non-liver dysfunction group (Schindl score\u2009<\u20094). Results The liver dysfunction group (47.3%) had significantly more patients who were obese, current smokers, and had diabetes, renal impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. Surgical site infections occurred predominantly in the liver dysfunction group (12.1% vs. 0.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The independent predictors of surgical site infection were liver dysfunction, body mass index\u2009>\u200930\u2009kg m-2, and coronary bypass surgery combined with other cardiac procedures. Conclusions Surgical wound infections can be precipitated by multiple factors before, during, and after coronary bypass surgery. Transient liver dysfunction in the perioperative period is associated with an increased rate of surgical infections even after adjusting for known risk factors. Considering this factor as well as other known risks may help to identify and stratify patients with a potentially higher risk of surgical site infections.",

A statin prescribing gap for PLWH has been reported, but appropriateness of statin selection and dosing (ASD) has not been described. METHODS: This is a comparative, retrospective study reviewing ASD in PLWH vs. uninfected patients at two outpatient clinics within an academic medical centre. Adults >\u00a021\u00a0years old indicated for statin therapy were included. The primary outcome was percentage of PLWH prescribed an appropriately dosed statin, accounting for clinical- and patient-related variables, compared with uninfected patients. The secondary outcome was to identify patient characteristics associated with inappropriately dosed statins. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 879 PLWH and 879 uninfected patients were included for analysis. Fewer PLWH (27.8%, n\u00a0=\u00a0244) were prescribed an ASD compared with uninfected patients (40.5%, n\u00a0=\u00a0356, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similar rates of statin omission were seen in both populations (P\u00a0=\u00a00.11). More PLWH received too low a dose compared with the uninfected population (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0064). There were lower ASD rates in PLWH for subgroups of patients with clinical ASCVD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00013) and 10-year ASCVD risk \u22657.5% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00055), but not in patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2265190\u00a0mg/dL or diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Although a statin gap exists in both PLWH and uninfected patients, the clinical significance may be greater for PLWH given the increased risk of ASCVD. This study confirms a larger statin gap in PLWH, particularly when underdosing of statin medications is considered. Additional analysis is warranted to investigate reasons for the ASD gap and beneficial clinical interventions.",

Machine learning (ML) may offer an improved alternative to current CVD risk stratification in individual patients. We aim to identify important predictors and compare ML models with traditional models according to their prediction performance in a large long-term follow-up cohort. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study was designed to study the progression of subclinical disease to cardiovascular events over a 25-year follow-up period. All phenotypic variables at visit 1 were obtained. All-cause death, CVD, and coronary heart disease were the outcomes for analysis. The ML framework involved variable selection using the random survival forest (RSF) method, model building, and 5-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated by discrimination using the Harrell concordance index (C-index), accuracy using the Brier score (BS), and interpretability using the number of variables in the model. RESULTS: Of the 14,842 participants in ARIC, the average age was 54.2 years, with 45.2% male and 26.2% Black participants. Thirty-eight unique variables were selected in the RSF top 20 importance ranking of all 6 outcomes. Aging, hypertension, glucose metabolism, renal function, coagulation, adiposity, and sodium retention dominated the predictions of all outcomes. The ML models outperformed the regression models and established risk scores with a higher C-index, lower BS, and varied interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: The ML framework is useful for identifying important predictors of CVD and for developing models with robust performance compared with existing risk models.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus infection is a usually self-limiting illness in adolescents. We present a case of an adolescent who had been receiving azathioprine for inflammatory bowel disease for four years and developed a life-threatening primary Epstein-Barr virus infection successfully treated with rituximab. CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old girl presented with chronic, bloody diarrhea. Endoscopic biopsies confirmed a diagnosis of chronic ulcerative colitis with features of Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was initiated after one year due to active colitis. She responded well and remission was achieved. At the age of 16\u2009years she developed a life-threatening Epstein-Barr virus infection including severe multiple organ failure and was critically ill for 4\u2009weeks in the intensive care unit. Natural killer cells were virtually absent in the lymphocyte subset analysis. Azathioprine was stopped on admission. She was initially treated with corticosteroids, acyclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin. Approximately 30\u2009days after admission, she developed signs of severe hepatitis and pneumonitis and received weekly rituximab infusions for 8\u2009weeks. Primary immunodeficiency was excluded by whole exome sequencing in two independent laboratories. Persistent viremia stopped when the natural killer cell count started to rise, approximately 90\u2009days after the cessation of azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: We found 17 comparable cases in the literature. None of the previous cases reported in the literature, who had been treated with azathioprine and developed either a severe or a fatal Epstein-Barr virus infection, underwent full genetic and prospective immunological workup to rule out known primary immunodeficiencies. Recently, azathioprine has been shown to cause rather specific immunosuppression, resulting in natural killer cell depletion. Our case demonstrates that slow recovery from azathioprine-induced natural killer cell depletion, 3\u2009months after the stopping of azathioprine, coincided with the clearance of viremia and clinical recovery. Finally, our choice of treating the patient with rituximab, as previously used for patients with a severe immunosuppression and Epstein-Barr virus viremia, appeared to be successful in this case. We suggest testing for Epstein-Barr virus serology before starting azathioprine and measuring natural killer cell counts during the treatment to identify patients at risk of developing an unusually severe primary Epstein-Barr virus infection.",

Methods: This was a longitudinal observational study of a retrospective cohort of patients with information extracted from electronic medical records of PC. Incident cases of HF from 2006 to 2010 or until death were studied through a survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression, after applying the propensity score matching technique (PSM). Results: A total of 3061 new cases of HF were identified. The PSM analysis was performed with 529 couples, with a total of 1058 patients. 5-year survival was 65% in no hospitalized and 53% in hospitalized patients. Factors with an increased risk of mortality were having prescribed nitrates (heart rate [HR] = 1.56; 1.08-2.24). Factors with protective effect were having received the annual influenza vaccine (HR = 0.04; 0.01-0.15) and having been indicated X-rays by PC physician (HR = 0.76; 0.67-0.88). Conclusions: The findings indicate that hospitalizations are associated with a significant increase in mortality in patients recently diagnosed with HF. It is important to reinforce the need for the prevention of acute decompensated HF and for strategies to improve post-discharge outcomes.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Patients with high anesthesiological risk due to old age, obesity and severe co-morbidities alone or in combination are considered as poor candidates for extensive surgical staging procedures, especially if through minimally invasive approach. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of robotic surgical staging of endometrial and cervical cancers in the medically ill patient. METHODS: Between 07-2007 and 12-2012, consecutive patients scheduled for staging for endometrial or cervical cancer were directed towards robotic staging and divided into two groups according to their starting score in the American Society for Anaesthesiologists (ASA): Group 1 (ASA 1-2) and Group 2 (ASA \u22653). RESULTS: Overall, 169 (71.9%) patients had ASA 1-2 whereas 66 (28.1%) had ASA \u22653. ASA \u22653 were older (p<0.0001) with a greater proportion of co-morbidities (p<0.0001), as well as of Class II (4.7% vs 19.7%; p=0.0007) and Class III obesity (2.4% vs 31.8%; p<0.0001). No differences were found between groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, intra- and post-operative complications, conversion rate and hospitalization. No differences were recorded either in terms of staging procedures performed or in terms of number of pelvic (p=0.72) and para-aortic (p=0.86) lymph nodes retrieved. CONCLUSIONS: Despite theoretical concerns about the performance of robotic surgery in patients with high anesthesiological risk, our experience showed that robotics is a feasible, safe and viable option for the management of endometrial and cervical cancers also in this more vulnerable group of patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technology is an increasingly recognized and effective method for disease management and has the potential to intervene in pulmonary function, exacerbation risk, and psychological status of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of an mHealth-based COPD management system designed for Chinese remote areas with many potential COPD patients but limited medical resources. METHODS: The system was implemented based on a tailored closed-loop care pathway that breaks the heavy management tasks into detailed pieces to be quantified and executed by computers. Low-cost COPD evaluation and questionnaire-based psychological intervention are the 2 main characteristics of the pathway. A 6-month prospective observational study at the community level was performed to evaluate the effect of the system. Primary outcomes included changes in peak expiratory flow values, quality of life measured using the COPD assessment test scale, and psychological condition. Acute exacerbations, compliance, and adverse events were also measured during the study. Compliance was defined as the ratio of the actual frequency of self-monitoring records to the prescribed number. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients was enrolled; 39 patients completed the 6-month study. There was no significant difference in the mean peak expiratory flow value before and after the 6-month period (366.1, SD 106.7 versus 313.1, SD 116.6; P=.11). Psychological condition significantly improved after 6 months, especially for depression, as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale (median 6.0, IQR 3.0-9.0 versus median 4.0, IQR 0.0-6.0; P=.001). The COPD assessment test score after 6 months of intervention was also lower than that at the baseline, and the difference was significant (median 4.0, IQR 1.0-6.0 versus median 3.0, IQR 0.0-6.0; P=.003). The median overall compliance was 91.1% (IQR 67%-100%). In terms of acute exacerbation, 110 exacerbations were detected and confirmed by health care providers (per 6 months, median 2.0, IQR 1.0-5.0). Moreover, 72 adverse events occurred during the study, including 1 death, 19 hospitalizations, and 52 clinic visits due to persistent respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and validated a feasible mHealth-based method to manage COPD in remote Chinese areas with limited medical resources. The proposed closed-loop care pathway was effective at the community level. Proper education and frequent communication with health care providers may encourage patients' acceptance and use of smartphones to support COPD self-management. In addition, WeChat might play an important role in improving patient compliance and psychological distress. Further research might explore the effect of such systems on a larger scale and at a higher evidence level.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed the influence of pre-operative intra-articular injections (IAI) on periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) rates after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Studies published between January 1st, 2000 and May 1st, 2021 evaluating PJI rates among TKA patients with and without IAI were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EBSCO Host, and Google Scholar. The pooled effect of IAI on PJI risk was calculated utilizing Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) models. Sub-analysis comparisons were conducted based on the interval from IAI to TKA: 0-3\u00a0months;\u2009>\u20093-6\u00a0months;\u2009>\u20096-12\u00a0months. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool were utilized to evaluate the quality of each included study. RESULTS: The present analysis included 12 studies reporting on 349,605 TKAs (IAI: n\u2009=\u2009115,122; No IAI: n\u2009=\u2009234,483). Patients receiving an IAI at any point prior to TKA (2850/115,122; 2.48%) had statistically significant increased risk of infection compared to patients not receiving IAIs (4479/234,483; 1.91%; OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.20; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). However, this finding was not demonstrated across sensitivity analyses. Receiving injections within 3\u00a0months prior to TKA was associated with increased infection risk (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14-1.31; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There were no differences in infection rates when injections were given between\u2009>\u20093 and 6\u00a0months (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.47-1.43; p\u2009=\u20090.49) and\u2009>\u20096-12\u00a0months prior to TKA (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.89-1.78; p\u2009=\u20090.18). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current literature, the findings of this analysis suggest that patients receiving IAI should wait at least 3\u00a0months before undergoing TKA to mitigate infection risk. Orthopaedic surgeons and patients can utilize this information when undergoing shared decision-making regarding osteoarthritis management options and timing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Evidence exists showing that various aspects of diet are implicated in the etiology of prostate cancer, although results across studies remain inconsistent. METHODS: We examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict prostate cancer in a case-control study conducted in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, between 1997 and 1999. The study included 72 cases of incident primary prostate cancer patients and 302 controls of urology clinic patients who had prostate conditions other than prostate cancer. The DII was computed based on intake of 18 nutrients assessed using a 67-item food frequency questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Men with higher DII scores were at increased risk of prostate cancer using DII score fit both as a continuous [OR = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-2.38] and categorical variable [compared to men in the lowest DII quartile, men in the highest quartile were at elevated risk (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.25-9.80; ptrend = 0.02)]. There was no significant heterogeneity by weight status, but stronger association was observed in men with body mass index >25\u00a0kg/m2 versus <25\u00a0kg/m2. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a proinflammatory diet, as indicated by increasing DII score, is a risk factor for prostate cancer.",

        "a": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Existing clinical decision rules guide management for head-injured children presenting 24 hours or sooner after injury, even though some may present greater than 24 hours afterward. We seek to determine the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries for patients presenting to emergency departments greater than 24 hours after injury and identify symptoms and signs to guide management. METHODS: This was a planned secondary analysis of the Australasian Paediatric Head Injury Rule Study, concentrating on first presentations greater than 24 hours after injury, with Glasgow Coma Scale scores 14 and 15. We sought associations with predictors of traumatic brain injury on computed tomography (CT) and clinically important traumatic brain injury. RESULTS: Of 19,765 eligible children, 981 (5.0%) presented greater than 24 hours after injury, and 465 injuries (48.5%) resulted from falls less than 1 m and 37 (3.8%) involved traffic incidents. Features associated significantly with presenting greater than 24 hours after injury in comparison with presenting within 24 hours were nonfrontal scalp hematoma (20.8% versus 18.1%), headache (31.6% versus 19.9%), vomiting (30.0% versus 16.3%), and assault with nonaccidental injury concerns (1.4% versus 0.4%). Traumatic brain injury on CT occurred in 37 patients (3.8%), including suspicion of depressed skull fracture (8 [0.8%]) and intracranial hemorrhage (31 [3.8%]). Clinically important traumatic brain injury occurred in 8 patients (0.8%), with 2 (0.2%) requiring neurosurgery, with no deaths. Suspicion of depressed skull fracture was associated with traumatic brain injury on CT consistently, with the only other significant factor being nonfrontal scalp hematoma (odds ratio 19.0; 95% confidence interval 8.2 to 43.9). Clinically important traumatic brain injury was also associated with nonfrontal scalp hematoma (odds ratio 11.7; 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 58.6) and suspicion of depressed fracture (odds ratio 19.7; 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 182.1). CONCLUSION: Delayed presentation after head injury, although infrequent, is significantly associated with traumatic brain injury. Evaluation of delayed presentations must consider identified factors associated with this increased risk.",

The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors holds a ray of hope for a subset of lung cancer patients, which have activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Much of the preliminary data on frequency of EGFR mutations emanated from Western studies, which reported EGFR mutation rates of 10-15%. However, studies from Asian countries report a much higher frequency of EGFR mutations, not only in the male population, but also in females. AIM: The object of this study was to share the author's experience of EGFR mutation testing in 402 lung cancer patients as no large-scale study addressing the issue has been published from India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues were analyzed for EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutation by length analysis of fluorescently labeled polymerase chain reaction products on Applied Biosystems Inc. 310 genetic analyzer. RESULTS: Out of 402 samples, 35 samples could not be analyzed because of poor deoxyribonucleic acid material. Thus of the remaining 367 cases analyzed, EGFR mutations were found in 118 patients (32%). Mutations were equally distributed between males (50%) and females (50%). Majority of the mutations were seen in adenocarcinoma subtype (90%). Exon 19 mutations accounted for 76% while exon 21 mutations accounted for 24% of the mutations.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical associations of the second allele mutations and the effect of genotype and presenting features on colchicine resistance in children with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), carrying at least one M694V variant. METHODS: The medical records of the patients diagnosed with FMF, in whom at least one allele M694V mutation was detected, were reviewed. Patients were grouped according to the genotype as M694V homozygotes, compound heterozygote M694V with an exon 10 mutation, compound heterozygote M694V with a variant of unknown significance (VUS), and M694V heterozygotes. Disease severity was assessed with the International Severity Scoring System for FMF. RESULTS: Among the 141 patients included, homozygote M694V (43.3%) was the most frequent MEFV genotype. Clinical manifestations of FMF at diagnosis were not significantly different according to genotypic alterations except homozygote M694V. Besides, homozygous M694V was associated with a more severe disease, with more frequent comorbidities and colchicine-resistant disease. A lower disease severity score was observed in compound heterozygotes with VUS than in M694V heterozygotes (median 1 vs 2, p = 0.006). Regression analysis revealed that homozygous M694V, arthritis, and frequency of attacks were associated with an increased risk of colchicine-resistant disease. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations of FMF at diagnosis with a M694V allele were predominantly influenced by the M694V rather than the second allele mutations. Although homozygous M694V was associated with the most severe form, the presence of compound heterozygosity with a VUS did not affect disease severity or clinical features. Homozygous M694V confers the highest risk of colchicine-resistant disease.",

A pathologic scoring system with prognostic utility has not been developed. We hypothesized that the extent of amyloid deposition and degree of scarring injury on kidney biopsy, could provide prognostic value, and aimed to develop pathologic scoring tools based on these features. METHODS: This is a case-control study of 39 patients treated for AL amyloidosis with biopsy-proven kidney involvement at a large academic medical center. Our novel scoring tools, composite scarring injury score (CSIS) and amyloid score (AS) were applied to each kidney biopsy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using electronic health data extracted from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum. Using the active comparator, new-user cohort design, we compared rates of VA among patients aged\u200918\u2009years or older using sulphonylurea monotherapy with those using metformin monotherapy as their initial pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes from April 1998 to December 2019. We used a Cox proportional hazards model with inverse probability of treatment weighting by propensity score to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and a corresponding bootstrap 95% confidence interval (CI) for VA with sulphonylurea monotherapy versus metformin monotherapy. RESULTS: The cohort included 92\u2009638 new users of sulphonylurea and 506\u2009882 new users of metformin. A total of 279 VA events occurred among sulphonylurea users (rate per 10\u2009000 person-years: 25.5, 95% CI: 22.7 to 28.7) and 1537 VA events occurred among metformin users (rate per 10\u2009000 person-years: 18.5, 95% CI: 17.6 to 19.5). Compared with metformin, sulphonylureas were associated with an increased risk of VA (aHR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.69). CONCLUSIONS: Sulphonylureas are associated with an increased risk of VA when used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes relative to metformin use. This increased risk should be considered when prescribing sulphonylureas as an initial treatment for type 2 diabetes.",

We sought to evaluate the effect of AP agents-categorized by their metabolic/sedative and hyperprolactinemia adverse effect profile-on the risk of venous thromboembolic disease during long-term follow-up. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients initiating AP treatment for the first time was conducted. Primary outcome was defined as the time to venous thromboembolism (VTE) (either deep venous thrombosis or acute pulmonary embolism). Antipsychotic agents were categorized by their risk (high vs low) of either drug-induced (a) sedation/metabolic adverse event or (b) hyperprolactinemia. We used a propensity score-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model to control for confounding. FINDINGS: One thousand eight patients (mean age, 72.4 y) were followed for a median of 36 months. Incident VTE occurred in 6.25% of patients, corresponding to an incidence rate of 184 cases per 10,000 person-years. We found no difference in the hazard of VTE during follow-up between high- and low-risk groups (hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% confidence interval, 0.74-2.04] for drug-induced sedation/metabolic adverse event risk categories, and hazard ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.35] for high versus low hyperprolactinemia risk). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the risk of thromboembolic events in older adults who started AP treatment for the first time does not seem to be related to these drugs' risk of either sedation/metabolic adverse events or hyperprolactinemia. However, VTE remains a common problem in this subgroup of patients.",

        "a": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The widening gap between the growing number of liver transplant candidates and the supply of deceased donor organs became a strong motivation for the development of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). LDLT has gone through its developmental phase and become an established life-saving procedure. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the challenging nature of the technique of LDLT, there have been continuous innovations. A better understanding of complex surgical anatomy and physiologic differences of partial hepatic allografts has helped to avoid graft congestion, small-for-size syndrome, or graft hypoperfusion from portal flow steal. LDLT for patients with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score can achieve comparable results with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). Size limitation of partial grafts can be overcome with dual grafts. The extended application of LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria seems feasible but at the cost of slightly compromised survival. More information has become available for prospective donors about the consequences of living liver donation in terms of psychosocial impact. SUMMARY: Although LDLT is still evolving, it has become the most effective alternative to DDLT. Proven or potential benefit of LDLT include the superior quality of the allograft despite the smaller size, selection of proper timing for transplantation and a reduced waiting time, which prevents waiting list mortality.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to comparison between cell-free placental messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and Doppler ultrasound for the prediction of placental invasion in women with placenta accreta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 50 pregnant women at risk for placenta accreta underwent color Doppler and assessment of cell-free placental mRNA. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used for measurement of cell-free placental mRNA in maternal plasma. Based on the findings at cesarean delivery and histological examination, patients were divided into two groups of women with and without placenta accrete. To compare of the mean of mRNA levels between the two groups we used independent t-test and to compare of the mean of age and gestational age at sonography we used Mann-Whitney test. For determination of sensitivity and specificity and the cut-off point of mRNA levels we used the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 50 women with a mean age of 30.24 \u00b1 4.905 years entered the study and 12 (24%) patients were diagnosed with placenta accreta. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of Doppler ultrasound were 83.3%, 78.9%, 56% and 94%, respectively. Results of our study showed if we consider a cut-off point equal to 3.325, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.789, respectively and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of mRNA with were cut-off point of 3.325 were 91.7%, 78.9%, 57.9% and 96.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cell-free mRNA is an acceptable, easy made, functional test with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV more than Doppler ultrasound for diagnosis and prediction of incidence of placenta accrete and we recommend the use of cell-free mRNA test for diagnosis of placenta accreta.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether MetS components might contribute to depression in participants with insulin resistance (IR) or not. METHODS: This study included 3,331 participants \u226518 years in the NHANES 2009-2010. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). MetS components were measured using blood chemistry and body measurements. IR was identified using the homeostasis model assessment method. RESULTS: Predicted PHQ-9 scores significantly increased as the number of MetS components increased in patients with IR. The adjusted \u03b2 coefficients of the predicted PHQ-9 score with 2, 4, and 5 MetS components were 1.803, 2.081, and 3.048, respectively (P for trend < 0.05). Low HDL-C levels were significantly associated with higher predicted total PHQ-9 scores in fully adjusted models in the IR group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the presence of a greater number of components of MetS was significantly associated with higher predicted total PHQ-9 scores in participants with IR. Among the components of MetS, the most apparent association was observed between low HDL and higher predicted total PHQ-9 scores.",

        "a": "The detection of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at an early stage presents a daunting challenge due to the lack of a specific noninvasive marker. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), particularly those found in serum, has opened a new avenue for tumor diagnosis. To determine whether the expression profile of serum miRNAs can serve as a NSCLC fingerprint, we performed Taqman probe-based quantitative RT-PCR assay to selected differentially expressed serum miRNAs from a sample set including 400 NSCLC cases and 220 controls, and risk score analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of the serum miRNA profiling system. After a two-phase selection and validation process, 10 miRNAs were found to have significantly different expression levels in NSCLC serum samples compared with the control serum samples. Risk score analysis showed that this panel of miRNAs was able to distinguish NSCLC cases from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. Under ROC curves, the AUC for tumor identification in training set and validation set were 0.966 and 0.972, respectively. Furthermore, the expression profile of the 10-serum miRNAs was correlated with the stage of NSCLC patients, especially in younger patients and patients with current smoking habits. More importantly, the serum miRNA-based biomarker for early NSCLC detection was supported by a retrospective analysis in which the 10-serum miRNA profile could accurately classify serum samples collected up to 33 months ahead of the clinical NSCLC diagnosis. Taken together, we demonstrate that the profiling of 10-serum miRNAs provides a novel noninvasive biomarker for NSCLC diagnosis.",

Inclusion criteria Randomised parallel group controlled trials of exercise training for at least eight weeks with individual patient data on survival for at least three months. Studies reviewed Nine datasets, totalling 801 patients: 395 received exercise training and 406 were controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death from all causes. RESULTS: During a mean (SD) follow up of 705 (729) days there were 88 (22%) deaths in the exercise arm and 105 (26%) in the control arm. Exercise training significantly reduced mortality (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.92; log rank chi(2) = 5.9; P = 0.015). The secondary end point of death or admission to hospital was also reduced (0.72, 0.56 to 0.93; log rank chi(2) = 6.4; P = 0.011). No statistically significant subgroup specific treatment effect was observed. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of randomised trials to date gives no evidence that properly supervised medical training programmes for patients with heart failure might be dangerous, and indeed there is clear evidence of an overall reduction in mortality. Further research should focus on optimising exercise programmes and identifying appropriate patient groups to target.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a pandemic health problem. Bariatric surgery is the only efficient method for long-term effective weight loss in subjects with severe obesity. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has been widely applied for weight loss. However, a novel technique called laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) has been proposed as an alternative to LAGB. Surgeons generally consider LAGBP to have a relative advantage on weight loss than that derived from LAGB. This initial study applied various biostatistical models and considered a relative longer observation period to compare the effects of LAGB and LAGBP. METHODS: A total of 340 obese patients (290 who underwent LAGB and 50 who underwent LAGBP) with a body mass index of \u226535 kg/m2 and ages 20 to 55 y were recruited from the Division of General Surgery, Taipei Medical University Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan and observed for 24 to 36 mo postoperatively. RESULTS: Both surgical procedures resulted in significant weight loss, amelioration of poor glucose metabolism, and decreased serum triacylglycerol levels. However, the trend analysis showed no significant differences between the postoperative effects of LAGB and LAGBP (P for trend\u202f=\u202f0.21 for body mass index reduction, 0.13 for total body fat percentage reduction, 0.25-0.29 for glucose metabolism amelioration, and 0.10-0.29 for blood pressure improvement). Improvements in serum total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed after LAGB only and LAGBP only, respectively, at 24 mo postoperatively. The Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk score also showed significant decrease for patients who underwent LAGB and LAGBP. CONCLUSIONS: Both LAGB and LAGBP demonstrated comparable efficacy in reducing body weight and improving metabolic parameters in a 24 to 36 mo follow-up period. LABG showed the ability to reduce systolic blood pressure and LAGBP exhibited triacylglycerol-lowering effects. A longer observational period is needed in future studies.",

        "a": "Observational studies have demonstrated that de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is independently associated with lower mortality. This most probably results from confounding by indication. Reaching clinical stability is associated with the decision to de-escalate and with survival. However, studies rarely adjust for this confounder. We quantified the potential confounding effect of clinical stability on the estimated impact of de-escalation on mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Data were used from the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We performed Cox proportional-hazards regression with de-escalation as time-dependent variable and adjusted for baseline characteristics using propensity scores. The potential impact of unmeasured confounding was quantified through simulating a variable representing clinical stability on day three, using data on prevalence and associations with mortality from the literature. Of 1,536 included patients, 257 (16.7%) were de-escalated, 123 (8.0%) were escalated and in 1156 (75.3%) the antibiotic spectrum remained unchanged. Crude 30-day mortality was 3.5% (9/257) and 10.9% (107/986) in the de-escalation and continuation groups, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio of de-escalation for 30-day mortality (compared to patients with unchanged coverage), without adjustment for clinical stability, was 0.39 (95%CI: 0.19-0.79). If 90% to 100% of de-escalated patients were clinically stable on day three, the fully adjusted hazard ratio would be 0.56 (95%CI: 0.27-1.12) to 1.04 (95%CI: 0.49-2.23), respectively. The simulated confounder was substantially stronger than any of the baseline confounders in our dataset. Quantification of effects of de-escalation on patient outcomes without proper adjustment for clinical stability results in strong negative bias. This study suggests the effect of de-escalation on mortality needs further well-designed prospective research to determine effect size more accurately.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of beta-blockers and statins for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events in intermediate-risk patients undergoing noncardiovascular surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Beta-blockers and statins reduce perioperative cardiac events in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery by restoring the myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance and/or stabilizing coronary plaques. However, their effects in intermediate-risk patients remained ill-defined. METHODS: In this randomized open-label 2 x 2 factorial design trial 1066 intermediate cardiac risk patients were assigned to bisoprolol, fluvastatin, combination treatment, or control therapy before surgery (median: 34 days). Intermediate risk was defined by an estimated risk of perioperative cardiac death and myocardial infarction (MI) of 1% to 6%, using clinical data and type of surgery. Starting dose of bisoprolol was 2.5 mg daily, titrated to a perioperative heart rate of 50 to 70 beats per minute. Fluvastatin was prescribed in a fixed dose of 80 mg. The primary end point was the composite of 30-day cardiac death and MI. This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry and has the ID number ISRCTN47637497. RESULTS: Patients randomized to bisoprolol (N = 533) had a lower incidence of perioperative cardiac death and nonfatal MI than those randomized to bisoprolol-control (2.1% vs. 6.0% events; hazard ratios: 0.34; 95% confidence intervals: 0.17-0.67; P = 0.002). Patients randomized to fluvastatin experienced a lower incidence of the end point than those randomized to fluvastatin-control therapy (3.2% vs. 4.9% events; hazard ratios: 0.65; 95% confidence intervals: 0.35-1.10), but statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.17). CONCLUSION: Bisoprolol was associated with a significant reduction of 30-day cardiac death and nonfatal MI, while fluvastatin showed a trend for improved outcome.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess resource utilization and outcome in gravely ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and the potential association with health care workers' and family members' expectations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated ICU patients with a predicted in-hospital mortality rate of 95% or higher (PM95) using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) on 2 consecutive days. All patients were admitted to a single institution between September 30, 1994, and August 9, 2001. RESULTS: The APACHE III database contained data from 38,165 ICU patients during the study interval. Of these, 248 (0.65% of ICU admissions) achieved PM95 status and were included in the study. Between PM95 and hospital discharge, resource utilization (eg, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, surgery, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) was extensive. A total of 23% of patients survived to hospital discharge, yet all but 1 were moderately or severely disabled. One year after achieving PM95, 10% (95% confidence interval, 7%-15%) of patients were alive. For 229 patients, the medical records contained physician documentation that indicated a likely fatal outcome. Thirty-six of these medical records documented unrealistic family expectations of a good outcome. The latter finding correlated with increased resource utilization without significant improvement in 1-year survival. In contrast, absence of physician documentation of a likely fatal outcome In 19 patients correlated with an improved likelihood of hospital (74%) and 1-year (47%) survival. CONCLUSION: Despite better-than-predicted survival outcomes, patient functionality and 1-year survival were poor. Unrealistic family expectations were associated with increased resource utilization without significant survival benefit, whereas absence of physician documentation of likely impending death (which correlated with improved survival) may denote the prognostication skills of experienced clinicians.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Assessing vaccine serologic status presents opportunities to provide live vaccinations to kidney transplant candidates (KTC). This is especially important given the increased risk of infection while taking lifelong immunosuppression following transplant and the inability to routinely provide live vaccines to patients on immunosuppressive medications. In March 2019, the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Disease Community of Practice (AST-IDCOP) released updated guidelines for vaccination of KTC, which emphasize pretransplant viral serology screening and live vaccine administration prior to transplant. PRIMARY ENDPOINT: The primary endpoint of this study was to determine adherence to AST-IDCOP guidelines for live measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and VZV vaccination prior to transplant in KTC non-immune by serology. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study examined serologic status and rates of live vaccination in 672 patients listed for kidney transplant at our center between July 2014 and July 2019. Secondary endpoints included subgroup analysis of adherence to full AST-IDCOP vaccination recommendations and validation of CDC presumed immunity definitions for measles and VZV. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (2.7%) were nonimmune by serology for VZV, while 182 (27.1%) were nonimmune by serology to MMR. In a subgroup analysis of the seronegative KTC, none received VZV vaccination, and 6% received MMR vaccination prior to transplant or last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a large portion of KTC had immunity gaps that were not resolved before transplantation. These findings are limited due to the retrospective, single-center nature of this study and should be confirmed with larger, prospective assessments of serologic status and vaccine administration.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can be associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) that may lead to skeletal morbidity. This study examined whether zoledronic acid can prevent bone loss associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized, open-label, phase III, four-arm trial comparing tamoxifen (20 mg/d orally) and goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days subcutaneously) +/- zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) versus anastrozole (1 mg/d orally) and goserelin +/- zoledronic acid for 3 years in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. In a BMD subprotocol at three trial centers, patients underwent serial BMD measurements at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: Four hundred one patients were included in the BMD subprotocol. Endocrine treatment without zoledronic acid led to significant (P < .001) overall bone loss after 3 years of treatment (BMD, -14.4% after 36 months; mean T score reduction, -1.4). Overall bone loss was significantly more severe in patients receiving anastrozole/goserelin (BMD, -17.3%; mean T score reduction, -2.6) compared with patients receiving tamoxifen/goserelin (BMD, -11.6%; mean T score reduction, -1.1). In contrast, BMD remained stable in zoledronic acid-treated patients (P < .0001 compared with endocrine therapy alone). No interactions with age or other risk factors were noted. CONCLUSION: Endocrine therapy caused significant bone loss that increased with treatment duration in premenopausal women with breast cancer. Zoledronic acid 4 mg every 6 months effectively inhibited bone loss. Regular BMD measurements and initiation of concomitant bisphosphonate therapy on evidence of bone loss should be considered for patients undergoing endocrine therapy.",

        "a": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease that can influence reproductive health. SSc has a strong female predominance, and the disease onset can occur during fertility age in almost 50% of patients. Preconception counseling, adjustment of treatment, and close surveillance during pregnancy by a multidisciplinary team, are key points to minimize fetal and maternal risks and favor successful pregnancy outcomes. The rates of spontaneous pregnancy losses are comparable to those of the general obstetric population, except for patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc and severe internal organ involvement who may carry a higher risk of abortion. Preterm birth can frequently occur in women with SSc, as it happens in other rheumatic diseases. Overall disease activity generally remains stable during pregnancy, but particular attention should be paid to women with major organ disease, such as renal and cardiopulmonary involvement. Women with such severe involvement should be thoroughly informed about the risks during pregnancy and possibly discouraged from getting pregnant. A high frequency of sexual dysfunction has been described among SSc patients, both in females and in males, and pathogenic mechanisms of SSc may play a fundamental role in determining this impairment. Fertility is overall normal in SSc women, while no studies in the literature have investigated fertility in SSc male patients. Nevertheless, some considerations regarding the impact of some immunosuppressive drugs should be done with male patients, referring to the knowledge gained in other rheumatic diseases.",

Life-threatening intraabdominal injuries occurred in 57.1% of lap-belted victims and in 26.7% of patients who used three-point restraints, and the character of these injuries also differed. No patients in an automobile in which an air bag deployed sustained major associated bodily injuries. Among restrained occupants of head-on motor vehicle accidents who have sustained a thoracolumbar fracture, patients using lap belts are more likely to sustain the classic flexion-distraction injury patterns, whereas patients using three-point restraints may sustain a higher incidence of burst fractures. In addition, three-point restraints are associated with a decreased risk of intraabdominal injury compared with lap seat belts.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The simultaneous use of several medications is an important risk factor for injurious falls in older people. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the number of medications dispensed to elderly persons on fall injuries and to assess whether this relationship is explained by individual demographics, health habits and health status. METHODS: A population-based, nested, case-control study on people 65\u00a0years and older (N\u2009=\u200920.906) was conducted using data from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort (SPHC) derived from self-administered surveys and linked at the individual level with various Swedish health registers. Fall injuries leading to hospitalization recorded in the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) were considered as the outcome. The main exposure, obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (SPDR), was the number of medications dispensed within 90\u00a0days prior to the injurious fall. The injury risk was estimated using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression. Results were adjusted by selected demographic, social circumstances, lifestyle and health status data extracted from the SPHC. RESULTS: After adjusting for common risk factors within demographics, lifestyle, social circumstances and health status, using more than one medication increased the risk of fall injury but no clear dose-response relationship was observed, with point estimates ranging from 1.5-1.7 for the use of two, three, four or five or more medications as compared to using none. An increased risk remained, and was even elevated, after adjusting for the use of fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs). CONCLUSIONS: Using more than one medication affects the risk of injurious falls among older people. The effect of any given number of medications studied remains and is even strengthened after adjusting for individual demographics, health habits, health conditions and the use of FRIDs.",

We enrolled 83 patients with CKD, 41 (49.4%) males, 42 (50.6%) females, with mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 23.90 \u00b1 12 (range = 6.0-56.0). BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) (anteroposterior, L2 through L4), femoral neck (FN) and femoral trochanter (FT) were measured by DEXA. Biochemical BTM, including calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum specific alkaline phosphatase (serum AP), bone-specific AP (BSAP), plasma bicarbonate and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25hD) were used for the prediction of BMD loss. T score results of LS and FN were worse than FT. BMD levels were lower in females than in males (all p < 0.05). According to different BMD T score levels, patients with age \u2265 65 years and patients in menopause were significantly more osteopenic (p = 0.026) and there was no relation between different BMD T scores and presence of diabetes (p = 0.654). A positive correlation was identified between the BMD of FN T-Z scores (r = 0.270, p = 0.029, r = 0.306, p = 0.012), FT T-Z scores (r = 0.220, p = 0.076, r:0.250, p = 0.043) and serum HCO3, while the correlation with serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) and BSAP was considered to be negative. No statistically significant association was found between BMD of all the measured skeletal sites and eGFR. Loss of BMD was identified mostly in females over \u2265 65 years of age and after menopause. Higher serum levels of BSAP and AP can be determined in the advanced stages of renal failure and they reflect fracture risk of the femur, but not spine. Measurements of BMD by DEXA are useful to demonstrate bone loss, but not technical enough to distinguish the quantity of bone loss between different stages of CKD.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality following cardiac valve surgery is high. Immunity is an important contributor to outcome. This study examines the relationship of staphylococcal and endotoxin antibody levels to outcome following cardiac surgery. METHODS: Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we measured pre-operative levels of antibodies to endotoxin core (EndoCAb); 3 common staphylococcal epitopes and varicella on saved serum of 60 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective primary surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Primary outcome measure was post-operative length of stay (LOS) in hospital with secondary outcomes being development of infective complications, length of stay on the intensive care unit (ICU) and 30-day mortality. Patients were quartiled according to antibody levels and outcomes compared between the quartile groups using Mann-Whitney tests for length of stay and Fisher's test for development of infection. RESULTS: Sixty patients (34 M, 26 F) were recruited with mean age 73\u00a0years (IQR 66-78), mean body mass index (BMI) 27.7 (IQR 25-31) and EuroSCORE II 1.44 (0.95-1.99). Those patients in the lower quartile for pre-operative antibody level had a longer post-operative stay than the upper quartile. EndoCAb (median IgG level Q1 42.2\u00a0MU/ml vs Q4 256\u00a0MU/ml) 9 vs 6\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.025; alpha-toxin (median IgG level Q1 63\u00a0U vs Q4 558\u00a0U) 10 vs 7\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.034; teichoic acid (median IgG level Q1 14\u00a0U vs Q4 419\u00a0U) 10 vs 8\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.441; staphylococcal enterotoxin A (median IgG level Q1 55\u00a0U vs Q4 427\u00a0U) 9 vs 7\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.865; varicella zoster (median IgG level Q1 1.325\u00a0U vs Q4 2.54\u00a0U) 8 vs 7\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20091.0; and combined antibody levels 10 vs 6\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.017. There were no differences in the number developing post-operative infections for each antibody type. The combined antibody analysis suggested a reduction in proportion of individuals developing infection from the upper vs lower quartile: 0 vs 0.33, p\u2009=\u20090.042. CONCLUSIONS: This study again suggests the inverse relationship between endotoxin core antibody levels and outcome following aortic valve surgery as well as suggesting a similar relationship with antibodies to staphylococcus. There is no such relationship for antibody levels against an organism not providing a peri-operative threat. Understanding this relationship may enable therapeutic manipulation of immune status, re-evaluation of risk and further investigation of the low immune state.

        "a": "PURPOSE: The Proximal Ulna Dorsal Angulation (PUDA) is part of the proximal ulna's normal anatomy. The importance of restoring ulnar anatomy characteristics precisely after olecranon fracture is not known, however, failure to recreate the PUDA after surgery may result in poorer functional outcomes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of minimal proximal ulna malunion on elbow ROM and function at least one year after olecranon ORIF. METHOD: A retrospective comparative cohort study took place in three level-1 trauma centers. Forty-nine adult volunteers who underwent ORIF for olecranon fracture were included. Patients were separated into two groups according to PUDA malreduction-defined as more than 5\u00b0 of difference between the fractured and the contralateral elbow. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Radiographic ROM measurement, demographic data and quality of life questionnaires were recorded (PREE, MEPS, Q-DASH, SF12, VAS). RESULTS: The mean follow up was 3 years and 9 months (1-7 years). There was no difference in terms of outcome, quality of reduction or range of motion between patients treated with plate or tension band. The mean PUDA on the fracture side was different from the normal side (2.20 vs 4.90, p<0.001). Fourteen patients (29%) had PUDA malunion. Those patients had decreased elbow flexion (-7\u00b0, p=0.011), extension (-11.2\u00b0, p=0.013) and total ROM (-18.6\u00b0, p=0.006) as opposed to the control group. Both groups had comparable quality of life questionnaire scores. Alcohol consumption was the only risk factor associated with worse scores. CONCLUSION: Incidence of olecranon malunion-as defined by PUDA measurement - was 29% and it was associated with decreased elbow range of motion. Alcohol consumption was correlated with a worse prognosis in our series of patients. Tension band and plate fixation can maintain a good reduction in terms of PUDA and the choice of fixation method does not influence outcome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Therapeutic study.",

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Fifty-eight survivors, fourteen non-survivors, and six healthy volunteers were enrolled. Serum kallistatin level was lower and serum VCAM-1 and E-selectin levels were higher in patients at admission compared with healthy volunteers. Serum kallistatin levels were higher in survivors compared with non-survivors at all time points (4.4 \u03bcg/mL [2.9-6.1] vs. 2.5 \u03bcg/mL [2.1-5.0], P = 0.019 at admission; 4.3 \u03bcg/mL [3.3-5.2] vs. 3.2 \u03bcg/mL [2.2-3.8], P = 0.004 at 24 h; 3.1 \u03bcg/mL [2.5-4.2] vs. 2.3 \u03bcg/mL [1.7-3.1], P = 0.012 at 72 h), while VCAM-1 and E-selectin levels showed no difference.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk factors of early ineffective recanalization, defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 4\u223c6 at two weeks after symptom onset, in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients receiving endovascular treatment (EVT). METHOD: One hundred eighty-four AIS patients who received EVT in 01/2016-12/2018 were analyzed. The recanalization rate was 81.5 % (150/184). Patients were divided into effective (mRS 0-3) and ineffective (mRS 4-6) recanalization groups. The independent risk factors for ineffective recanalization were analyzed. RESULT: The ineffective recanalization rate was 67.3 % (101/150 cases) at 14 days after symptom onset. Twenty-five patients (24.8 %) in the ineffective recanalization group had coronary heart disease, higher than that in the effective group (4 patients, 8.2 %, P\u202f=\u202f0.016). Infratentorial pathology accounted for 34.7 % (35 cases) of the ineffective group and only 14.3 % (7 cases) of the control group (P\u202f=\u202f0.011). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in the ineffective group than in the effective group (146\u202fmmHg vs 140\u202fmmHg, P\u202f=\u202f0.038). General anesthesia was more common in the ineffective group than in the control group (49 cases, 48.5 %, vs 9 cases, 18.4 %; P\u202f=\u202f0.000). Logistic regression showed that coronary heart disease (odds ratio (OR)\u202f=\u202f3.399, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.013-11.401, P\u202f=\u202f0.048), unconsciousness before EVT (OR\u202f=\u202f4.292, 95 % CI 1.963-9.386, P\u202f=\u202f0.000), SBP (OR\u202f=\u202f1.016, 95 % CI 0.997-1.035, P\u202f=\u202f0.090) and general anesthesia (OR\u202f=\u202f3.378, 95 % CI 1.395-8.180, P\u202f=\u202f0.007) were independent risk factors for ineffective recanalization.

        "a": "AIM: Radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment of hepatic neoplasms can be performed through percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgery. The aim of this study was to point out the details of the role of open RF (ORF). METHODS: Between November 2002 and November 2003, we performed 13 ORFs. Seven patients had an association with chronic liver cirrhosis. With the aid of intraoperative single, internally cooled needle RF, 12 liver resections were performed (7 subsegmentectomies, 3 segmentectomies, 1 left lateral lobectomy, and 1 right lobectomy). In 1 case RF was applied directly to the tumor lesion. In all cases ultrasonography (US) was performed intraoperatively, other lesions were found in 7.7% of the cases. RF energy was applied along the margins of the tumor to create <<zones of necrosis>> before resection with a scalpel. RESULTS: Average operating time for ORF alone was 74.4 minutes (range 30-115 minutes). Mean intraoperative blood loss during the procedure was 104 mL (range 25-250 mL), and blood transfusions were required in 3 patients. Mean hospital stay was 7.9 days (range 6-10 days). Only minor complications were found, and no mortality was observed. No liver recurrence was detected during mean follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is suitable for patients who are at risk of bleeding because it offers a new method for transfusion-free resection, reducing postoperative complications and shorter long-term survival. Adequate follow-up is necessary to judge its true efficacy, in terms of recurrence and survival.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Although the GRACE risk scores (RS) are the preferred scoring system for risk stratification in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), little is known whether these RS still maintain their performance in the current era. We aimed to investigate this issue in a contemporary population with ACS. METHODS: The study population composed of patients enrolled in the MASCARA national registry. The GRACE RS were calculated for each patient. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated with the C statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, in the whole population and according to the type of ACS, risk strata, and whether the patient had a history of diabetes and/or chronic renal failure. We determined if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) provides incremental prognostic information above that established by the RS and whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during admission affects the performance of the score for predicting 6-month mortality. RESULTS: The 5,985 patients constituted the validation cohort for the in-hospital mortality RS and 5,635 the validation cohort for the 6-month mortality RS. Overall, both GRACE RS demonstrated excellent discrimination (C > 0.80) and calibration (all P values in Hosmer-Lemeshow >.1). Although similar results were seen in all subgroups, the 6-month mortality RS performed significantly less well in patients undergoing PCI compared to those patients who did not (C = 0.73 vs 0.76, P < .004). Adding LVEF to the RS did not convey significant prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: The GRACE RS for predicting in-hospital and 6-month mortality still maintain their excellent performance in a contemporary cohort of patients with ACS. Further studies are needed to investigate the performance of the 6-month mortality GRACE score in patients undergoing in-hospital PCI. Left ventricular ejection fraction did not convey significant information over that provided by the RS.",

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 6-week open randomized study included 89 inpatients and outpatients. Basic criteria of efficacy were \u226550% reduction of HAMD total score and remission (\u22647 points) to the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of the study (day 42), the highest number of patients with 50% reduction of HAMD total score was noted in the sertraline (65%) and combination therapy (60%) groups, in the valproate group it was 57.1%, and the lowest - in agomelatine group (42.9%), but the differences were not statistically significant. Remission was observed in 45% patients in combination therapy group compared with 33.3% in valproate group, 32.1% in agomelatine group and only 20% in group of sertraline, but the differences between the groups also were not significant. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants (agomelatine and sertraline) have demonstrated fast but insufficient influence on the reduction of depression in the patients. Treatment with sertraline rarely led to remission and was frequently associated with high rate of switch into hypomania. Valproate therapy was moderately effective and well-tolerated without risk of switching. Combination of valproic acid with sertraline had the highest efficacy and was fairly well tolerated.",

        "a": "Maxillofacial trauma poses an obvious threat to the patient's airway, which may not be immediately evident. In the multiply injured patient, the co-existence of actual or potential injuries elsewhere may complicate airway management, notably in the presence of full spinal immobilization. Following high-velocity trauma, injuries to the cervical spine must be assumed to be present. They also need to be ruled out in an appropriate and timely manner, as patients may wish to sit up. Assessment and management of the airway in maxillofacial trauma can be difficult, requiring a senior anaesthetist or other individual appropriately trained in emergency airway care. A number of management options may exist to protect the airway, each with advantages and drawbacks. Agitation and vomiting can occur unexpectedly and need to be managed safely with due consideration to the spine. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons need to be aware of these dilemmas and their early warning signs, and be skilled in emergency surgical airway procedures, especially if involved as part of the trauma team.

        "a": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of patellar instability in pediatric patients ranges is 50-100 in 100,000 patients per year. Risk of recurrent dislocations however has been cited from 8.6% to 88% depending on individual patient factors. This manuscript highlights the demographical, historical, and anatomic factors associated with recurrent patellar instability following a first-time patella dislocation in the pediatric population. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, various studies have focused on identifying risk factors for recurrent patellar instability following a primary patellar dislocation. A mix of patient factors, including age of first dislocation, patella alta, elevated tibial tubercle to trochlear groove and trochlear dysplasia have all been noted in the literature, which have helped to develop various scoring tools to predict recurrent dislocation following nonoperative treatment. SUMMARY: Risk of recurrent patellar instability in patients who have previously suffered a patellar dislocation can be due to many factors. These risk factors should be used and applied to a variety of risk scores in order to provide physicians and healthcare providers with a tool to counsel patients and families on their patellar redislocation risk and help guide further management.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level > or =80 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal examination. RESULTS: Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was found between major chest injury and abdominal injury. CONCLUSION: The incidence of abdominal injury in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation is low. Physical examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal evaluation without CT.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with the development of colorectal neoplasia (CRN). A group at St. Mark's Hospital reported a novel cumulative inflammatory index that predicted the development of CRN in UC patients that we validated with an independent, well-described, matched, case-controlled cohort from the University of Chicago. METHODS: Cumulative inflammatory burden (CIB) was calculated by summing each histological inflammatory activity (HIA) score and multiplying it by the length of the surveillance interval. Persistency was defined by the number of surveillance episodes (with a severity score >2) divided by the total number of surveillance procedures. T tests compared the mean and maximum HIA scores, assessing mean and maximum severity, CIB, and persistency. RESULTS: Sixty-two UC patients (26 patients with CRN, 36 control patients without CRN) were analyzed. Fifty-five percent were men, mean disease duration was 20.6 years, and mean age at CRN diagnosis was 43.9. Of the CRN patients, 6 (23%) had colorectal cancer, 16 (62%) had low-grade dysplasia, and 4 (15%) had indefinite dysplasia. Using mean HIA scores, we found CIB to be statistically greater in CRN patients (P = 0.04). Using maximum HIA scores, we found CIB (P = 0.02), mean severity (P = 0.03), and persistency (P = 0.01) to be significantly greater in CRN patients. Maximum severity was numerically greater for mean and maximum HIA scores but did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: Cumulative histologic inflammation is significantly associated with the development of CRN in UC patients. This suggests a management strategy of controlling inflammation to reduce the risk of CRN and may influence the selection of surveillance intervals.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a new protocol, using a rapid and sensitive CK-MB(mass) assay and serial sampling, can rule out myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain and decrease their length of stay in the cardiac emergency room without increasing risk. DESIGN: The combined incidence of cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction at 30 days, six months, and 24 months of follow up were compared between patients discharged home from the cardiac emergency room after ruling out myocardial infarction with a CK-MB(activity) assay in 1994 and those discharged home after a rapid CK-MB(mass) assay in 1996. SETTING: Cardiac emergency room of a large university hospital. PATIENTS: In 1994 and 1996, 230 and 423 chest pain patients, respectively, were discharged home from the cardiac emergency room with a normal CK-MB and an uneventful observation period. RESULTS: The median length of stay in the cardiac emergency room was significantly reduced, from 16.0 hours in 1994 to 9.0 hours in 1996 (p < 0.0001). Mean event rates in patients from the 1994 and 1996 cohorts, respectively, were 0.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.3% to 2.1%) v 0.7% (95% CI -0.1% to 1. 5%) at 30 days, 3.0% (95% CI 0.8% to 5.2%) v 2.8% (95% CI 1.2% to 4. 4%) at six months, and 7.0% (95% CI 3.7% to 10.3%) v 5.7% (95% CI 3. 5% to 7.9%) at 24 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in mean event-free survival at 30 days, six months, and 24 months of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Using a rule-out myocardial infarction protocol with a rapid and sensitive CK-MB(mass) assay and serial sampling, the length of stay of patients with chest pain in the cardiac emergency room can be reduced without compromising safety.",

        "a": "Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease may manifest as a metabolic disorder with pathology and/or dysfunction in numerous tissues. Adults with Alzheimer's disease suffer with significantly more comorbidities than demographically matched Medicare beneficiaries (Zhao et al, BMC Health Serv Res 8:108, 2008b). Reciprocally, comorbid health conditions increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (Haaksma et al, PLoS One 12(5):e0177044, 2017). Type 2 diabetes mellitus is especially notable as the disease shares many overlapping pathologies observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and cognitive dysfunction, as described in Chap. 8 of this book (Yoshitake et al, Neurology 45(6):1161-1168, 1995; Leibson et al, Am J Epidemiol 145(4):301-308, 1997; Ott et al, Neurology 53(9):1937-1942, 1999; Voisin et al, Rev Med Interne 24(Suppl 3):288s-291s, 2003; Janson et al. Diabetes 53(2):474-481, 2004; Ristow M, J Mol Med (Berl) 82(8):510-529, 2004; Whitmer et al, BMJ 330(7504):1360, 2005, Curr Alzheimer Res 4(2):103-109, 2007; Ohara et al, Neurology 77(12):1126-1134, 2011). Although nondiabetic older adults also experience age-related cognitive decline, diabetes is uniquely associated with a twofold increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, as described in Chap. 2 of this book (Yoshitake et al, Neurology 45(6):1161-1168, 1995; Leibson et al, Am J Epidemiol 145(4):301-308, 1997; Ott et al. Neurology 53(9):1937-1942, 1999; Ohara et al, Neurology 77(12):1126-1134, 2011). Good glycemic control has been shown to improve cognitive status (Cukierman-et\u00a0al, Diabetes Care 32(2):221-226, 2009), and the use of insulin sensitizers is correlated with a lower rate of cognitive decline in older adults (Morris JK, Burns JM, Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep 12(5):520-527, 2012). At the molecular level, the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in maintaining energy homeostasis. Nutrient availability and cellular stress information, both extracellular and intracellular, are integrated and transduced through mTOR signaling pathways. Aberrant regulation of mTOR occurs in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and in numerous tissues of individuals with type 2 diabetes (Mannaa et al, J Mol Med (Berl) 91(10):1167-1175, 2013). Moreover, modulating mTOR activity with a pharmacological inhibitor, rapamycin, provides wide-ranging health benefits, including healthy life span extension in numerous model organisms (Vellai et al, Nature 426(6967):620, 2003; Jia et al, Development 131(16):3897-3906, 2004; Kapahi et al, Curr Biol 14(10):885-890, 2004; Kaeberlein et al, Science 310(5751):1193-1196, 2005; Powers et al, Genes Dev 20(2):174-184, 2006; Harrison et al, Nature 460(7253):392-395, 2009; Selman et al, Science 326(5949):140-144, 2009; Sharp ZD, Strong R, J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 65(6):580-589, 2010), which underscores its importance to overall organismal health and longevity. In this chapter, we discuss the physiological role of mTOR signaling and the consequences of mTOR dysregulation in the brain and peripheral tissues, with emphasis on its relevance to the development of Alzheimer's disease and link to type 2 diabetes.",

        "a": "Childhood maltreatment (CM) is regarded as an important risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the neural links corresponding to the process of early CM experience producing brain alterations and then leading to depression later remain unclear. To explore the neural basis of the effects of CM on MDD and the potential role of microRNA-9 (miR-9) in these processes, we recruited 40 unmedicated MDD patients and 34 healthy controls (HCs) to complete resting-state fMRI scans and peripheral blood miR-9 tests. The neural substrates of CM, miR-9, and depression, as well as their interactive effects on intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity (AFC) networks were investigated in MDD patients. Two-step mediation analysis was separately employed to explore whether AFC strength mediates the association among CM severity, miR-9 levels, and depression. A support vector classifier (SVC) model of machine learning was used to distinguish MDD patients from HCs. MDD patients showed higher miR-9 levels that were negatively correlated with CM scores and depressive severity. Overlapping effects of CM, miR-9, and depressive severity on bilateral AFC networks in MDD patients were primarily located in the prefrontal-striatum pathway and limbic system. The connection of amygdala to prefrontal-limbic circuits could mediate the effects of CM severity on the miR-9 levels, as well as the impacts of miR-9 levels on the severity of depression in MDD patients. Furthermore, the SVC model, which integrated miR-9 levels, CM severity, and AFC strength in prefrontal-limbic regions, had good power in differentiating MDD patients from HCs (accuracy 85.1%). MiR-9 may play a crucial role in the process of CM experience-produced brain changes targeting prefrontal-limbic regions and that subsequently leads to depression. The present neuroimaging-epigenetic results provide new insight into our understanding of MDD pathophysiology.",

We previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11066001) in the BRAP gene was related to the risk of myocardial infarction. However, it is unclear whether rs11066001 is associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. METHODS: We enrolled 732 patients scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography. Angiographic presence of significant CAD (0 or 1), clinical vessel score (CVS, 0-3 vessels) and diffuse score (DS, 0-11.5) were used to evaluate the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. Genotyping was carried out by the TaqMan technology. RESULTS: Of all patients, 558 (76.2%) had significant CAD. The odds ratio for the GG to the AA genotype was 2.45 (95% CI 1.13-5.34, p = 0.024) for the presence of significant CAD. The CVS was correlated with the frequency of genotypes in the recessive model (p = 0.001). Regression analysis showed a significant association between rs11066001 and the presence of significant CAD and DS (all p < 0.05). There was a synergistic effect between rs11066001 and diabetes on the occurrence of significant CAD (p < 0.001 for interaction). CONCLUSION: The BRAP rs11066001 gene is associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and has a synergistic effect with diabetes on the occurrence of significant CAD in the Chinese population.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with acute pulmonary embolism(APE)who present with right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) have a worse prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the value of routine biochemical parameters in predicting RVD and 30-day mortality in patients with APE. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data for 154 enrolled patients, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). We analyzed the correlation between RVD and the parameters and conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to confirm the cut-off values for predicting RVD and 30-day mortality. Formulas were built with relevant parameters to predict RVD and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Age, NLR, PLR, D-dimer, the ratio of cTnI (+), and NT-proBNP (+) were significantly higher in RVD (+) patients. The ratio of cTnI (+) and NT-proBNP (+) in 30-day mortality (+) patients was significantly higher than that in 30-day mortality (-) patients. According to the logistic regression analysis, NLR, cTnI (+), and NT-proBNP (+) correlated with RVD. The formula for the RVD risk score is 0.072\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NLR+1.460\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NT-proBNP (+)+2.113\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0cTnI (+), and the area under the curve (AUC)\u00a0=\u00a00.890 (95% CI: 0.839-0.941, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). The formula for the 30-day mortality risk score is 0.115\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NLR + 2.046\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NT-proBNP (+) + 1.946\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0cTnI (+) -0.016\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PLR, and the AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.903 (95% CI: 0.829-0.976, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001).

This study examines the role of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in high-risk groups. METHODS: Patients with pathologic stage Ia and stage Ib NSCLC who underwent complete (R0) resection between January 2009 and June 2013 were identified from Peking University People's Hospital and classified into two groups based on postoperative chemotherapy or not. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to compare disease free survival (DFS). Scored according to the number of risk factors, all patients were divided into three groups. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to compare DFS between them. The effect of postoperative chemotherapy on high-risk group was observed individually. RESULTS: A total of 465 patients including 284 cases of stage Ia and 181 cases of stage Ib were enrolled in this study. For stage Ia there was no significant difference between the chemotherapy group and the control group in DFS (P=0.171), but the survival curve of the chemotherapy group was located below the control group. For stage Ib there was no significant difference between the two groups either (P=0.630). But there were significant differences on DFS between the three groups according to the number of risk factors (P<0.001). The more risk factors mean the worse DFS. However, independent analyses showed no significant effect of postoperative chemotherapy on DFS in the high-risk group patients (P=0.763). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemotherapy does not have a positive effect on DFS in early stage non-small cell lung cancer, and chemotherapy may not be appropriate even for patients with multiple risk factors.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The right fibrous trigone, which the His bundle penetrates, is part of the subaortic area adjacent to the membranous septum. Structural alterations of the right fibrous trigone may cause conduction disturbance as a result of compression in this area after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. This study analyzed the hypothesis of whether imaging parameters of the RFT could predict the risk of conduction disturbance after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 209 patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantationat a tertiary cardiac center. The different valve models were divided into 2 groups: self-expanding valve and balloon-expandable valve. Using pre-procedure computed tomography, we evaluated for the alterations of the right fibrous trigone. RESULTS: New conduction disturbance was seen in 75 of 209 (35.8%) patients. Receiver operating characteristics plots displayed a right fibrous trigone density of -6 Hounsfieldunit for SEV and -16 Hounsfield unit for balloon-expandable valve as the optimal cut- off points for prediction conduction disturbance. In multiple regression analyses, the high density of RFT emerged as an independent predictor of conduction disturbance in both the self-expanding valve (odds ratio: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.02, P = 0.035) and bal- loon-expandable valve (odds ratio: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03, P = 0.017) groups. A shorter membranous septum length and a greater implantation depth were also found to be significantly associated with a higher incidence of conduction disturbance in both trans- catheter aortic valve implantation groups. CONCLUSION: High density of right fibrous trigone is independently associated with con- duction disturbance after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and its pre-proce- dure computed tomography evaluation can help predict the new-onset of conduction disturbance.",

During-UPMV, VT ranged 2-5\u2009mL/kg PBW(3.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73), the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was higher than pre-UPMV values (84.81\u2009\u00b1\u200918.95 cmH2O vs. 69.16\u2009\u00b1\u200933.09 cmH2O), but pH was comparable and none received extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2-R). The positive end-expiratory pressure (14.18\u2009\u00b1\u20097.56 vs. 12.31\u2009\u00b1\u20096.84 cmH2O), PIP (38.21\u2009\u00b1\u200912.89 vs. 32.59\u2009\u00b1\u20099.88), and mean airway pressures (19.98\u2009\u00b1\u20097.61 vs. 17.48\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\u2009cm H2O) were higher during UPMV, but Pplat and PaO2/FiO2 were comparable during- and pre-UPMV. Driving pressure was observed to be higher in those who died than who survived (24.18\u2009\u00b1\u200912.36 vs. 13.42\u2009\u00b1\u20093.25). CONCLUSION: UPMV alone may be a safe alternative option for ARDS patients in centers without ECCO2-R.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Assessments of NSAID use based on authoritative guidelines typically overlook patients' views and nuances of medical history. Our objective was to develop an assessment tool that incorporates these aspects, and technical items, for quality of care assessments in NSAID users. METHODS: Patients newly referred to a university hospital were interviewed by a nurse using an agreed template. A multidisciplinary group of rheumatologists, nurse specialists, primary care physicians and a pharmacist reviewed current guidance and systematic reviews on NSAID use, and a series of interview transcripts. The group agreed, by informal consensus, important determinants of effective and safe NSAID use. Technical aspects of medical care and items that reflected interpersonal care were included in an index for assessing quality of care for individual patients. Interview transcripts of 100 patients were scored by panel members and reliability of scores was tested by calculating weighted percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. RESULTS: Our final index had five domains: medical risk factors; steps taken to reduce risk; knowledge of adverse effects; NSAID dose; and cost efficiency. Each item was scored 0, 1 or 2. Scores were summed, giving a maximum of 10 (low scores indicating low quality). Intra-rater agreement was >90%; kappa was 0.47-0.87 for individual domains and 0.59 for overall score. Inter-rater agreement for overall score was 95%; kappa was 0.25-0.78 for domains and 0.48 for overall score. Patients with especially low scores were identified using the mode of scores for five assessors; obvious clinical concerns were identified, supporting index face validity. CONCLUSIONS: A simple index to evaluate quality of care for NSAID users based on a patient interview is described. This may be used by one or more assessors to examine care standards and highlight deficiencies in relation to NSAID use in practice.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate associations between a readily availvable composite measurement of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage (the area deprivation index) and 30-day readmissions for patients who were previously hospitalized with sepsis. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: An urban, academic medical institution. PATIENTS: The authors conducted a manual audit for adult patients (18 yr old or older) discharged with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition code of sepsis during the 2017 fiscal year to confirm that they met SEP-3 criteria. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The area deprivation index is a publicly available composite score constructed from socioeconomic components (e.g., income, poverty, education, housing characteristics) based on census block level, where higher scores are associated with more disadvantaged areas (range, 1-100). Using discharge data from the hospital population health database, residential addresses were geocoded and linked to their respective area deprivation index. Patient characteristics, contextual-level variables, and readmissions were compared by t tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The associations between readmissions and area deprivation index were explored using logistic regression models. A total of 647 patients had an International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition diagnosis code of sepsis. Of these 647, 116 (17.9%) either died in hospital or were discharged to hospice and were excluded from our analysis. Of the remaining 531 patients, the mean age was 61.0 years (\u00b1 17.6 yr), 281 were females (52.9%), and 164 (30.9%) were active smokers. The mean length of stay was 6.9 days (\u00b1 5.6 d) with the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 4.9 (\u00b1 2.5). The mean area deprivation index was 54.2 (\u00b1 23.8). The mean area deprivation index of patients who were readmitted was 62.5 (\u00b1 27.4), which was significantly larger than the area deprivation index of patients not readmitted (51.8 [\u00b1 22.2]) (p < 0.001). In adjusted logistic regression models, a greater area deprivation index was significantly associated with readmissions (\u03b2, 0.03; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who reside in more disadvantaged neighborhoods have a significantly higher risk for 30-day readmission following a hospitalization for sepsis. The insight provided by neighborhood disadvantage scores, such as the area deprivation index, may help to better understand how contextual-level socioeconomic status affects the burden of sepsis-related morbidity.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the predictive values of the Hessisch Oldendorf Risk of Falling Scale (HOSS, \"Hessisch Oldendorfer Sturzrisiko Skala\") for two timeframes: the first month of rehabilitation and from the second month to the end of rehabilitation. METHODS: Scale performances were assessed for 512 patients during inpatient neurological rehabilitation by calculating the sensitivity and the specificity. HOSS items were entered into a binary logistic regression model. Fall rates were calculated and used for correlation analyses and group comparisons. RESULTS: Initial HOSS assessment showed a sensitivity of 80.4% and a specificity of 60.7%. The HOSS re-assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 67.3% and a specificity of 69.5%. Only a non-somnolent state was identified to increase the risk of falling in both timeframes. Patients with a moderate impaired functional status (Barthel-Index between 20 and 50 points) showed the highest fall rates. CONCLUSION: The predictive validity of the HOSS decreases during the rehabilitation course. This might be caused by an altered relevance of the HOSS items during the re-assessment compared to the initial assessment for which the HOSS was developed for.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Many arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be treated with one modality, but with increasing complexity a combination of techniques, including surgical excision, embolization, and radiosurgery, may be beneficial. The 2 senior authors' experience in the multimodal management of AVMs from 1980-2008 is reported, including the results in all patients with rehemorrhage while awaiting treatment or after partial initial treatment has begun. The series contains a disproportionately high number of Spetzler-Martin grade IV and V lesions, owing to the nature of the referral practice. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively. Only patients who were managed until treatment options were exhausted were included; this entailed either treatment to the point of AVM obliteration or inability to treat further using any or all modalities. Patients who presented with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in extremis in whom the AVM was excised during the first operation were also included. RESULTS: Of the 290 patients, 265 underwent treatment, and 25 were managed conservatively. An unruptured AVM was present in 48% of patients. Cure was achieved in 233 (88%) of treated patients. Cure was achieved in 25 of 37 patients undergoing radiosurgery only, 56 of 57 undergoing surgery, 100 of 101 undergoing embolization and microsurgical excision, 20 of 34 undergoing embolization alone, 12 of 17 undergoing embolization and radiosurgery, 5 of 5 undergoing surgery and radiosurgery, and 14 of 14 patients undergoing all 3 modalities. Spetzler-Martin grade was found to correlate negatively with cure (P < 0.001). There was a good outcome in 210 patients (72%), moderate disability in 40 patients (14%), severe disability in 22 patients (8%), vegetative state in 1 patient, and 17 patients (6%) died. There was a favorable outcome (no or only moderate deficits) in 93% of patients with Spetzler-Martin grade I-III lesions. The outcome was favorable in 13 of 25 patients (52%) having no treatment, 32 of 37 (86%) having radiosurgery only, 30 of 34 (88%) having embolization only, 54 of 57 (95%) having surgery only, 87 of 101 (86%) having embolization and surgery, 16 of 17 (94%) having embolization and radiosurgery, 5 of 5 (100%) having surgery and radiosurgery, and 13 of 14 (93%) having all 3 modalities. These outcomes included morbidity from initial presenting symptoms, from treatment, and from rehemorrhage. Good recovery was more likely in patients who were treated with surgery as one of the treatments (P = .025). Considering only new deficits related to treatment, 9 patients (3%) incurred severe neurologic deficits, 11 patents died after treatment, 2 patients died of postoperative hematomas, and 6 died of rehemorrhage from residual AVM. Increasing age, Spetzler-Martin grade, and rehemorrhage were correlated with a poorer Glasgow Outcome Scale score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a higher risk of hemorrhage after partial obliteration of AVM. One should ascertain an acceptably high likelihood of complete obliteration before embarking on treatment. Using a multimodality approach, the authors were able to cure 92% of treated Spetzler-Martin grade I-IV lesions but only 53% of treated Spetzler-Martin grade V lesions. A major neurologic deficit, disabling to the patient, was incurred in 3% of cases, and 11 patients died.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: With a growing elderly population worldwide, the prevalence of dementia is rapidly increasing. Studies from high income countries have shown that belonging to a minority ethnic group increases the risk of health disadvantages. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present registry-based study was to identify potential differences in diagnostics, treatment, and care of individuals with dementia focusing on foreign-born in Sweden and the impact of country level socioeconomic position (SEP). METHODS: The study was based on a large dataset from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) and the Swedish Tax Agency's population registry. Data on demographic variables, cognitive tests, clinical assessments, medication, diagnosis, and interventions initiated at diagnosis were collected. Country level SEP was determined by country of birth as classified by World Bank Country and Lending groups. RESULTS: Of 57,982 patients with dementia registered in SveDem, 7,171 (12.4%) were foreign-born. The foreign-born were significantly younger at diagnosis (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), had a lower MMSE score (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), lower odds of receiving a specific dementia diagnosis (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), lower use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), and overall a higher use of neuroleptics compared with the Swedish-born group. The lower SEP, the greater differences to Swedish-born were seen in many of the examined variables. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in dementia diagnostics, treatment, and care between foreign-born and Swedish-born, a lower SEP indicating greater differences. Further research should focus on various socioeconomic aspects and health care outcomes for a more profound analysis of equity in dementia care.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether routine screening with the Flemish version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool (fTRST) is a valid approach to determine which patients on cardiac care wards are at risk for inhospital functional decline and would benefit from geriatric expertise consultation. METHODS: A secondary data-analysis of the G-COACH before-cohort, describing patient profiles and routine care processes, in 189 older adults on two cardiac care wards in the University Hospitals Leuven between September 2016 and June 2017. Inhospital functional decline was defined as an increase of at least one point on the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living or death between hospital admission and discharge. RESULTS: Nine in 10 patients had at least one geriatric syndrome and one-third developed functional decline. Based on the fTRST proposed cut-off of \u22652, 156 (82.5%) patients were at risk for functional decline (sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 23.8%, negative predictive value of 90.9% and Area Under the Curve of 0.60). Of the 156 'at risk' patients, 43 (27.6%) received a consultation by the geriatric consultation team after a median of four hospitalization days. A positive fTRST was not significantly related to geriatric consultations (x2\u00a0=\u00a00.57; p =\u00a00.45). CONCLUSION: The fTRST has a low discriminative value in identifying older cardiology patients at risk for functional decline. Given the high prevalence of geriatric syndromes, we propose a new paradigm were all older adults on cardiac care wards undergo a needs assessment upon hospital admission.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognostic risk factors of bloodstream infection (BSI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, furthermore, to provide a reliable evidence for early warning and treatment for the critical patients with BSI. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed. The clinical data of patients with blood culture-positive admitted to ICU of the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University from January 1 to September 30, 2019 were analyzed. The data including gender, age, proportion of basic diseases, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), the duration of mechanical ventilation after being diagnosed with BSI, length of stay in ICU, aggressive operation and blood product infusion after BSI, proportion of using continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and continuous vasoactive agents for more than 72 hours after being diagnosed with BSI, and site of central venous catheterization were recorded. Meantime, the worst laboratory values within 72 hours after being diagnosed with BSI, information about pathogenic microorganism categories and distributions were collected and analyzed. The patients were divided into survival and death groups based on the the 28-day prognosis, and the differences of clinical data between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to select the independent prognostic risk factors of BSI. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-four patients with positive results of BSI were enrolled, and the 156 strains of bacteria were detected, including 75 Gram positive (G+) bacteria strains, 70 Gram negative (G-) bacteria strains and 11 fungi strains among those BSI patients. The top five pathogenic microorganisms were Coagulase negative staphylococcus (35.9%), Klebsiella pneumonia (12.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.0%), Enterococci (9.0%), and Escherichia coli (8.3%). There were 45 strains (60.0%) of multidrug-resistant strains in G+ bacteria and 40 strains of multidrug-resistant strains (57.1%) in G- bacterial strains, but in fungi there was only 1 strain (9.1%). There were 81 cases in survival group and 73 cases in death group according to 28-day prognosis. We found that there were no significant differences between the comparators in age, lenth of stay in ICU, duration for mechanical ventilation after being diagnosed with BSI, percentage of BSI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney dysfunction (all P > 0.05). In death group, the proportion of male was obviously lower than that of survival group [58.9% (43/73) vs. 75.3% (61/81), P < 0.05] and APACHE II score was significantly higher than that in survival group (27.1\u00b17.0 vs. 19.5\u00b16.7, P < 0.05). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) of death group on first 3 days of BSI was significantly lower than that of survival group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.8\u00b113.6 vs. 79.7\u00b112.9, P < 0.05), in the death group, the proportion of patients complicated with diabetes, cancer [28.8% (29/73) vs. 12.3% (10/81), 19.2% (14/73) vs. 7.4% (6/81)], post-BSI CRRT and blood transfusion [39.7% (29/73) vs. 16.0% (13/81), 64.4% (47/73) vs. 46.9% (38/81)], and continuous use of asoactie drugs for \u2265 72 hours [37.0% (27/73) vs. 12.3% (10/81)] were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P < 0.05). In death group, platelet count (PLT) was significantly decreased than that of survival group [\u00d7109/L: 124.93\u00b198.21 vs. 181.15\u00b1116.39,P < 0.05], aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was significantly higher than that of survival group [U/L: 75.40 (38.50, 140.95) vs. 56.20 (29.20, 85.70), P < 0.05], the rest of the laboratory indexes had no statistically significant differences between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The results of Logistic regression analysis showed that the APACHE II score [odds ratio (OR) = 1.279, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.158 to 1.412, P < 0.001], CRRT after BSI (OR = 3.522, 95%CI was 1.013 to 12.245, P = 0.048) were independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with BSI, and MAP is a protective factor for prognosis (OR = 0.961, 95%CI was 0.927 to 0.996, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: In our ICU, G+ bacteria are still dominant in bloodstream infection, G- bacteria take the second place.

METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional, population-representative, internet-based study conducted among men and women aged \u2265\u200940\u00a0years were analysed post hoc. Nocturia prevalence and bother were analysed by sex and age group, and with regard to comorbid conditions and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Multivariate and univariate logistic regression models to identify risk factors for nocturia were constructed, with nocturia involving \u2265\u20092 nocturnal voids as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Among the 8284 participants, the prevalence of nocturia involving \u2265\u20091,\u2009\u2265\u20092, or\u2009\u2265\u20093 voids was slightly higher for women (76.1, 37.3, and 17.5%, respectively) compared with men (74.0, 34.5, and 15.5%, respectively). The prevalence and associated bother of nocturia increased with age. Greater proportions of patients with comorbid conditions or wet/more severe overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) experienced nocturia than those without.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes of patients who underwent closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) with cannulated screws for treatment of a displaced femoral neck fracture (DFNF) as they were deemed too high risk to undergo hemiarthroplasty (HA). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: One urban academic medical center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients treated with CRPP and 32 risk-level-matched patients treated with HA. INTERVENTION: CRPP for patients with DFNFs who were deemed too ill to undergo HA. The concept being that CRPP would aid in pain control and facilitate mobilization and if failed, the patient could return electively after medical optimization for conversion to arthroplasty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Complications, readmissions, mortality, inpatient cost, and functional status. RESULTS: The CRPP cohort had a greater incidence of exacerbations of chronic medical conditions or new onset of acute illness and an elevated mean American Society of Anesthesiologist score. There were no differences in discharge location, length of stay, major complication rate, ambulation before discharge, or 90-day readmission rate. Patients undergoing CRPP were less likely to experience minor complications including a significantly decreased incidence of acute blood loss anemia. Three patients (18.7%) in the CRPP cohort underwent conversion to HA or THA. There was no difference in inpatient, 30-day, or 1-year mortality. CONCLUSION: In the acutely ill patients with DFNFs, \"damage control\" fixation with CRPP can be safely performed in lieu of HA to stabilize the fracture in those unable to tolerate anesthesia or the sequelae of major surgery. Patients should be followed closely to evaluate the need for secondary surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

IUGR is one of the most important causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR is also related future comorobidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and coronary artery disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty pregnancies diagnosed as IUGR (Group 1) and fifty healthy pregnancies (Group 2) enrolled into the study. Obstetric and demographic characteristics of the patients, serum elabela levels, ultrasound parameters, cord pH value and APGAR scores of the newborns were recorded. In the study, which was planned as a prospective case-control study, an independent t test was used for the evaluation of continuous data and the Mann Whitney U test was used for the statistical evaluation of ordinal data. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean gestational age of the cases at delivery was 36.35 \u00b1 1.29 in Group 1 and 38.16 \u00b1 0.94 weeks in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Mean serum Elabela levels were 15.05 \u00b1 9.03 in Group 1 and 8.96 \u00b1 4.33 ng/mL in Group 2 (p < 0.0001). Mean newborn weights were 2498.20 \u00b1 465.92 in Group 1 and 3179.44 \u00b1 387.99 gr. in Group 2 (p < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements taken on the day of delivery were higher in Group 1, and diastolic blood pressure was 77.0 \u00b1 9.53 in Group 1 and 72.60 \u00b1 13.37 mmHg in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Bilateral uterine artery Pulsatile Index (PI) and umbilical artery PI value were significantly higher in Group 1 (p < 0.05), and middle cerebral artery PI and cerebroplacental ratio were significantly lower in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p < 0.05). Although the cord pH value, 1st and 5th minute APGAR scores were lower in Group 1 compared to Group 2, no statistically significant difference was found (p > 0.05). CONLUSIONS: In our study, it was found that serum Elabela levels increased significantly in pregnancies complicated by IUGR compared to the control group.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The advantages of LPD compared with OPD remain debatable. The study aimed to compare the laparoscopic (LPD) versus open (OPD) for pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized studies (RCTs) comparing LPD and OPD was made. The results were reported as relative risk (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). The trial sequential analysis was used to test the type I and type II errors defining the required information size (RIS). The primary outcome was mortality, major morbidity, and postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). R1 resection, post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, biliary fistula, reoperation, readmission, operative time (OT), lymph nodes harvested, and length of stay (LOS) were also studied. RESULTS: Four RCTs, counting 818 patients, were found. The RRs for mortality, major morbidity, and POPF were 1.16, 1.04, and 0.86, without significant differences. The RISs were 35,672, 16,548, and 8206. To confirm this equivalence, at least 34,854, 15,730, and 7338 should be randomized. OT was significantly longer in LPD than OPD, with an MD of 63.22. The LOS was significantly shorter in LPD than in OPD, with -\u00a01.76\u00a0days. The RISs were 1297 and 1273, excluding a false-positive result. No significant differences were observed for the remaining endpoints, and RISs suggested that more than 3000 patients should be randomized to confirm the equivalence. CONCLUSION: The equivalence of LPD and OPD for mortality, major morbidity, and POPF is affected by type II error. The RISs to demonstrate a superiority of one of the two techniques seem unrealistic to obtain.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The STOPBANG questionnaire is used to predict the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We sought to assess the performance of the STOPBANG questionnaire in younger, thinner patients referred to a sleep medicine clinic. METHODS: We applied the STOPBANG questionnaire to patients referred for level I polysomnography (PSG) at our sleep center. We calculated likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve and performed sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We performed our analysis on 338 patients referred for PSG. Only 17.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a058) were above age 50\u00a0years, and 30.5 and 6.8% had a BMI above 30 and 35\u00a0years, respectively.

The STOPBANG (threshold \u22653) identified 83.1% of patients as high risk for an AHI \u22655, and sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were 83.8, 18.0, 64.4, and 38.0%, respectively.

Sensitivity analyses adjusting for insomnia, combat deployment, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, clinically significant OSA (ESS >10 and/or co-morbid disease), and obesity did not significantly alter STOPBANG performance. CONCLUSIONS: In a younger, thinner population with predominantly mild-to-moderate OSA, the STOPBANG Score does not accurately predict the presence of obstructive sleep apnea.",

        "a": "AIMS: Only limited data exist about the role of point of care CYP2C19 testing in the acute setting in the early phase of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the impact of CYP2C19 loss-of-function point-of-care (POC) genotyping in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and treated with dual antiplatelet therapy in the emergency setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: 137 subjects with ACS scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention were consecutively enrolled. Pre- and on-treatment platelet aggregation was assessed by multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Patients were loaded according to current guideline adherent indications and contraindications for use of P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS. POC genotyping for CYP2C19*2 was performed in the emergency room after obtaining a buccal swab using the Spartan RX CYP2C19 system and obtaining patient's informed consent. Prasugrel and ticagrelor treated patients had significantly lower PR compared to clopidogrel-treated patients. The benefits of prasugrel and ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel treated patients in terms of platelet inhibition were more pronounced in CYP2C19*2 carriers. Non-carriers showed similar inhibition regardless of particular P2Y12 inhibitor treatment. Statistical analyses adjusting for factors associated with response (e.g. smoking) revealed that CYP2C19*2 allele carrier status and loading with different type of P2Y12 receptor blockers were significant predictors of on-treatment platelet reactivity in the early phase of ACS. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study of treatment of patients in the early phase of ACS indicate that CYP2C19*2 POC genotyping might help to identify patients at risk with poor response to clopidogrel treatment, thereby benefiting from reloading and switching to alternative P2Y12 receptor inhibition.",

Part of this risk may be attributable to remnant cholesterol, which is carried in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We evaluated the relationship between remnant cholesterol and coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden assessed non-invasively by computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a multicentre study of 587 patients who had a CTCA and fasting lipid profile within 3 months. Calculated remnant cholesterol was total cholesterol minus LDLC minus high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Significant coronary atherosclerotic burden was defined as CT-Leaman score >5 (CT-LeSc), an established predictor of cardiac events. Mean age was 61\u202f\u00b1\u202f12 years and mean pretest probability of CAD was 23.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f19.8%. LDLC levels were <1.8\u202fmmol/L in 134 patients (23%), of whom 82% were statin-treated. Patients with CT-LeSc >5 had higher mean remnant cholesterol than those with CT-LeSc \u22645 (0.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.36\u202fmmol/L vs. 0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.33\u202fmmol/L, p\u202f=\u202f0.01). On univariable analysis, remnant cholesterol (p\u202f=\u202f0.01), LDLC (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and HDLC (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) levels predicted CT-LeSc >5, whilst triglycerides (p\u202f=\u202f0.79) had no association with CT-LeSc >5. On multivariable analysis in the subset of patients with optimal LDLC levels, remnant cholesterol levels remained predictive of CT-LeSc >5 (OR 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.34-7.55, p\u202f=\u202f0.004), adjusted for HDLC and traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Remnant cholesterol levels are associated with significant coronary atherosclerotic burden as assessed by CTCA, even in patients with optimal LDLC levels. Future studies examining whether lowering of remnant cholesterol can reduce residual IHD risk are warranted.",

Delaying treatment and applying it only if there is evidence of progression requires a careful identification of these patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels lower than 10 \u03bcg/L and Gleason score lower than 7 are the main criteria used to select patients for active surveillance based on experience accumulated in the last two decades. In the selection of patients with active surveillance two points are taken into consideration: (a) Gleason score changes introduced by the Consensus Conference of 2005; (b) differences between assays in the measurement of PSA serum levels, in the selection of patients for active surveillance. Improving the accuracy of patient's selection for active surveillance requires that Gleason score reassignment must be taken into account, as well as the harmonization between PSA assays. The use of incorrect results leads to misclassification of patients, undermining the goals of active surveillance.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Pharyngeal pressure-flow analysis (PFA) of high resolution impedance-manometry (HRIM) with calculation of the swallow risk index (SRI) can quantify swallow dysfunction predisposing to aspiration. We explored the potential use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to model the relationship between PFA swallow metrics and aspiration and to predict swallow dysfunction. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive dysphagia patients referred for videofluoroscopy and HRIM were assessed. Presence of aspiration was scored and PFA software derived 13 metrics and the SRI. An ANN was created and optimized over training cycles to achieve optimal classification accuracy for matching inputs (PFA metrics) to output (presence of aspiration on videofluoroscopy). Application of the ANN returned a value between 0.00 and 1.00 reflecting the degree of swallow dysfunction. KEY RESULTS: Twenty one patients were excluded due to insufficient number of swallows (<4). Of 179, 58 aspirated and 27 had aspiration pneumonia history. The SRI was higher in aspirators (aspiration 24 [9, 41] vs no aspiration 7 [2, 18], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and patients with pneumonia (pneumonia 27 [5, 42] vs no pneumonia 8 [3, 24], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The ANN Predicted Risk was higher in aspirators (aspiration 0.57 [0.38, 0.82] vs no aspiration 0.13 [0.4, 0.25], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and in patients with pneumonia (pneumonia 0.46 [0.18, 0.60] vs no pneumonia 0.18 [0.6, 0.49], p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Prognostic value of the ANN was superior to the SRI. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In a heterogeneous cohort of dysphagia patients, PFA with ANN modeling offers enhanced detection of clinically significant swallowing dysfunction, probably more accurately reflecting the complex interplay of swallow characteristics that causes aspiration.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with cirrhosis are classified in a compensated and a decompensated stage. Portal hypertension is responsible for most of the complications of cirrhosis that mark the transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis. The objectives of this study were (a) to analyse survival of the different stages and substages of cirrhosis and (b) to examine the prognostic value of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) at each of the stages. METHODS: A total of 729 patients with suspected cirrhosis underwent routine measurement of portal pressure and systemic haemodynamics between 11/1995 and 12/2004. The primary end-point of the study was death, collected until November 30th, 2006. Multivariable analysis was performed using two models to determine predictors of death at each stage. RESULTS: A total of 443 patients were included in the study. The 1-year mortality was 5.4% in compensated and 20.2% in decompensated patients. Compensated patients in stage 1 (no varices) had a longer survival than stage 2 patients (varices present) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). In decompensated patients, survival was not different between stage 3 (ascites, with or without varices) and stage 4 (variceal haemorrhage, with or without ascites). Age and HVPG (cut-off 10\u00a0mmHg) were independent predictors of death in compensated patients, whereas MELD was in decompensated patients. CONCLUSION: Survival rates and predictors of death are different between patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Unlike the Italian cohort staging system, ascites is a better stratifying clinical event than variceal haemorrhage in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The presence of clinically significant portal hypertension has prognostic value in compensated cirrhosis.",

Data of 195 patients were retrospectively analysed. Post-reperfusion aspartate (AST), alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were the primary measures of IRI. Tumour recurrence was the primary endpoint. Post-reperfusion AST was a continuous risk factor for tumour recurrence in patients within Milan criteria (p\u2009=\u20090.035), with an optimal cut-off of 1896 U/L.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Urate is a potent antioxidant, and high plasma urate has been associated with lower incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) in epidemiological studies. We tested the hypothesis that high concentrations of plasma urate are associated with low incidence of PD. METHODS: We performed observational and genetic analyses using plasma urate and the urate SLC2A9 rs7442295 and ABCG2 rs2231142 genotype in >102,000 individuals from the CGPS (Copenhagen General Population Study). Information on PD and mortality was from national patient and death registries. Incidences of PD were calculated using Cox regression, Fine and Gray competing-risks regression, and instrumental variable analyses. RESULTS: In total, 398 individuals were diagnosed with PD, of which 285 were incident cases. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for PD was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.77) for the highest versus the lowest tertile of plasma urate (p for trend across 3 groups, 8 \u00d7 10-5 ). Each one-allele increase in the combined allele score was associated with 19\u03bcmol/l (95% CI, 18.5-19.9) higher plasma urate. In observational analyses, a 50\u03bcmol/l higher plasma urate was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.85 (0.77-0.92) for PD; in instrumental variable analyses, 50\u03bcmol/l higher plasma urate was associated with an odds ratio of 1.20 (0.85-1.71) for PD. INTERPRETATION: High plasma urate was associated with lower risk of PD in observational analyses; however, in instrumental variable analysis, high plasma urate was not associated with low risk of PD. Thus, our data do not support a causal relationship between high plasma urate and low risk of PD. Ann Neurol 2018;84:178-190.",

We seek to study the association between pre-stroke subjective sleep status and cognitive function at 3 months after stroke. Patients and methods: Data were analyzed for 1,759 AIS patients from the Impairment of Cognition and Sleep after Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack in Chinese Patients Study (ICONS). Pre-stroke subjective sleep status was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Greater sleep fragmentation was defined as waking up in the middle of the night or early morning \u22653 times a week. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 3 months after stroke. Primary endpoint was the incidence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) at 3 months after stroke. The association between subjective sleep status and PSCI was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: PSCI occurred in 52.1% at 3 months after stroke. Patients with very bad sleep quality before stroke were at increased risk of PSCI (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.11-4.03; P=0.03). Subgroup analysis found that the association between very bad sleep quality and PSCI was more evident among patients with high school education or above (OR, 5.73; 95% CI, 1.92-17.10; P for interaction=0.02). In addition, patients with greater sleep fragmentation before stroke were also at higher risk of PSCI (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.20-2.01; P<0.01). Similarly, subgroup analysis showed that the risk of PSCI was more pronounced among patients without employment (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.59-3.77; P for interaction=0.01). Conclusion: Very bad sleep quality and greater sleep fragmentation before stroke were identified as independent risk factors for PSCI at 3 months after stroke.",

METHODS: The treated vertebrae bodies were divided into four groups: group A, non-posterior vertebral wall defect; group B, posterior vertebral wall with cribriform defects; group C, posterior vertebral wall with local fragmentation defects; group D, posterior vertebral wall with severe defects. The injected volume of bone cement, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), cement leakage and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The injected volume of bone cement for group A was significantly higher than posterior wall defect group (including group B, C, and D). No significant differences about the injected volume of bone cement among the posterior wall defect groups. The incidence of bone cement leakage for group A was not significantly different as compared to posterior vertebral wall defect group. However, there were significant differences with respect to the incidence of bone cement leakage among the posterior wall defect groups. In four groups the postoperative VAS pain scores and KPS were statistical different as comparison to the preoperative values. No statistical difference with respect to the VAS pain scores and KPS was observed at any time point between the non-posterior wall defect group and posterior wall defect group. CONCLUSION: PVP can be an effective treatment for metastatic spinal tumors in patients with posterior wall deficiency; however, care should be taken to control the distribution of the bone cement due to the relatively high risk of cement leakage.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Transfusion of red blood cells is recurrent in cardiac surgery despite the well-established deleterious effects. Identifying patients with higher chances of requiring blood transfusion is essential to apply strategic preventive measures to reduce such chances, considering the restricted availability of this product. The most used risk scores to predict blood transfusion are the Transfusion Risk and Clinical Knowledge (TRACK) and Transfusion Risk Understanding Scoring Tool (TRUST). However, these scores were not validated for the Brazilian population. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of TRACK and TRUST scores in estimating the need for postoperative transfusion of red blood cell concentrates (TRBCC) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A clinical retrospective study was conducted using the database of a Brazilian reference service composed of patients operated between November 2019 and September 2021. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test assessed calibration of the scores. Accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). All analyses considered a level of significance of 5%. The study was approved by the research ethics committee (CAAE 55577421.4.0000.5201). RESULTS: This study assessed 498 patients. Only the TRACK score presented good calibration (P=0.238; TRUST P=0.034). AUC of TRACK was 0.678 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.73; P<0.001), showing a significant accuracy. CONCLUSION: Between the scores analyzed, only the TRACK score showed a good calibration, but low accuracy, to predict postoperative TRBCC after cardiac surgery.",

        "a": "CONTEXT: Apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (ACRD) is a rarely ascertained condition characterized by signs of androgen excess in women or children and decreased urinary excretion of cortisol metabolites compared with cortisone metabolites. These findings suggest a deficiency of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1; encoded by the HSD11B1 gene), which normally converts cortisone to cortisol. Common polymorphisms in both HSD11B1 and the hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) gene encoding hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have been found together in ACRD patients, who carry three of a possible four minor alleles at the two loci. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to confirm the postulated digenic inheritance mechanism for ACRD. DESIGN: This was a population-based association study (Dallas Heart Study). Subjects were genotyped for the 1971T>G polymorphism in intron 3 of HSD11B1 and the R453Q polymorphism in H6PD. SUBJECTS: The study comprised 3551 individuals in a population-based sample (50% black, 35% white, and 15% Hispanic). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was association between genotypes and risk for polycystic ovarian syndrome. RESULTS: Both polymorphisms occurred more frequently than previously reported. Thus, ACRD genotypes (at least three of four minor alleles) occurred in 7.0% of subjects. There were no associations between genotype and body mass index; waist/hip ratio; visceral adiposity; measures of insulin sensitivity; levels of testosterone, FSH, or LH (in females); or risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome. There was no genotype effect on urinary free cortisol/cortisone or corticosteroid metabolite ratios, which were measured in 10 subjects, each carrying zero, three, or four minor alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Previously reported associations of ACRD with HSD11B1 and H6PD alleles represent ascertainment bias. However, rare severe mutations in these genes cannot be ruled out.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: In China, Wuling capsule, a traditional Chinese medicine consisting of Wuling mycelia of Xylaria nigripes (Kl.) Sacc (a rare type of fungus), is used to treat major depressive disorders. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of Wuling capsule alone with Wuling capsule-antidepressant combination in the treatment of major depressive disorders. METHODS: Two assessors independently selected studies, extracted data, and conducted quality assessment and data synthesis. Standard mean difference, risk ratio (RR) \u00b1 95% confidence interval (CI), the number needed to treat, and the number needed to harm were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomised controlled trials (880 patients; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 39.7 \u00b1 12.5 years; male patients, 41%) were identified, including 4 trials with Wuling capsule alone (n = 340) and 8 with Wuling capsule-antidepressant (sertraline, mianserin, mirtazapine, and paroxetine) combination (n = 540). The mean length of trial was 5.7 \u00b1 1.3 weeks. Meta-analysis of symptomatic improvement at last-observation endpoint and study-defined response and remission revealed no significant differences between the Wuling capsule alone and antidepressant monotherapy. The Wuling capsule-antidepressant cotreatment was superior to antidepressant monotherapy in symptomatic improvement at last-observation endpoint (standard mean difference: -0.46, p = 0.001) as well as study-defined response (68.4% vs. 56.0%, RR = 1.23; p = 0.03) and remission (46.5% vs. 34.5%, RR = 1.35; p = 0.05). Wuling capsule was associated with fewer adverse drug reactions than antidepressant monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive Wuling capsule may augment the effects of antidepressants and may be associated with fewer adverse drug reactions. More large-scale and rigorously designed randomised controlled trials with large sample size are warranted to clarify the effectiveness of Wuling capsule for major depressive disorders.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: BK polymavirus (BKPyV), a member of the family Polyomaviridae, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. METHODS: In our previous retrospective study of 2477 stem cell transplant patients, BKPyV replication independently predicted chronic kidney disease and poor survival. In this study, using the same cohort, we derived and validated a risk grading system to identify patients at risk of BKPyV replication after transplantation in a user-friendly modality. We used 3 baseline variables (conditioning regimen, HLA match status, and underlying cancer diagnosis) that significantly predicted BKPyV replication in our initial study in a subdistribution hazard model with death as a competing risk. We also developed a nomogram of the hazard model as a visual aid. The AUC of the ROC of the risk-score-only model was 0.65. We further stratified the patients on the basis of risk score into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. RESULTS: The total risk score was significantly associated with BKPyV replication (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). At 30\u00a0days after transplantation, the low-risk (score\u00a0\u2264\u00a00) patients had a 9% chance of developing symptomatic BKPyV replication, while the high-risk (score\u00a0\u2265\u00a08) of the population had 56% of developing BKPyV replication. We validated the risk score using a separate cohort of 1478 patients. The AUC of the ROC of the risk-score-only model was 0.59. Both the total risk score and 3-level risk variable were significantly associated with BKPyV replication in this cohort (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This grading system for the risk of symptomatic BKPyV replication may help in early monitoring and intervention to prevent BKPyV-associated morbidity, mortality, and kidney function decline.",

        "a": "AIM: To investigate the prevalence of biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a cohort of patients with morbid obesity and with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to find non-invasive predictors of NASH severity. METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 412 subjects (age 19-67 years, body mass index-BMI: 44.98\u00a0kg/m2), who underwent fine-needle liver biopsy during bariatric surgery. Thirty-six percent of the subjects were affected by T2D. Liver biopsies were classified according to the Kleiner's NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), AST/ALT ratio, AST to Platelet ratio (APRI), fibrosis-4 score (FIB4) were calculated. A neural network analysis (NNA) was run to predict NASH severity. RESULTS: The prevalence of biopsy-proven NASH was 63% and 78% in subjects with obesity and without or with T2D, respectively. T2D doubled the risk of NASH [OR 2.079 (95% IC=1.31-3.29)]. The prevalence of NAFL increased with the increase of BMI, while there was an inverse correlation between BMI and NASH (r=-0.145 p=0.003). Only mild liver fibrosis was observed. HOMA-IR was positively associated with hepatocyte ballooning (r=0.208, p<0.0001) and fibrosis (r=0.159, p=0.008). The NNA highlighted a specificity of 77.3% using HDL-cholesterol, BMI, and HOMA-IR as main determinants of NASH. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a higher prevalence of NASH in patients with morbid obesity than reported in the literature and the pivotal role of T2D among the risk factors for NASH development. However, the inverse correlation observed between BMI and biopsy-proven NASH suggests that over a certain threshold adiposity can be somewhat protective against liver damage. Our model predicts NASH presence with high specificity, thus helping identifying subjects who should promptly undergo liver biopsy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of (significant) prostate cancer ((s)PC) is impeded by overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsy. Risk calculators (RC) have been developed to mitigate these issues. Contemporary RCs integrate clinical characteristics with mpMRI findings. OBJECTIVE: To validate two of these models-the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4 and the risk model of van Leeuwen. METHODS: 265 men with clinical suspicion of PC were enrolled. Every patient received a prebiopsy mpMRI, which was reported according to PI-RADS v2.1, followed by MRI/TRUS fusion-biopsy. Cancers with ISUP grade \u2265\u20092 were classified as sPC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis was performed by comparing discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility RESULTS: There was no significant difference in discrimination between the RCs. The MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4-RC showed a nearly ideal calibration-slope (0.94; 95% CI 0.68-1.20) than the van Leeuwen model (0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.88). Within a threshold range up to 9% for a sPC, the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4-RC shows a greater net benefit than the van Leeuwen model. From 10 to 15%, the van Leeuwen model showed a higher net benefit compared to the MRI-ERSP-3/4-RC. For a risk threshold of 15%, the van Leeuwen model would avoid 24% vs. 14% compared to the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4 model; 6% vs. 5% sPC would be overlooked, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both risk models supply accurate results and reduce the number of biopsies and basically no sPC were overlooked. The van Leeuwen model suggests a better balance between unnecessary biopsies and overlooked sPC at thresholds range of 10-15%. The MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4 risk model provides better overall calibration.",

        "a": "Our aim was to identify the optimal diagnostic cutoff point on the scale of protrusion measurements of the first metatarsal (M1) to predict the probability of reulceration after metatarsal head resection in patients with diabetes mellitus. We conducted a prospective study of patients with diabetes who underwent resection of at least 1 metatarsal head in our department. After surgery, we measured the difference in length (protrusion) between the M1 and the longest of the 4 lesser metatarsals by radiographic view. The patients were divided into those in whom the M1 was the longest of the 5 metatarsals (group 1) and patients in whom at least one of the lesser metatarsals was longer than the M1 (group 2). They were followed-up for 12 months and were assessed for reulceration. Ninety-one patients were included in the present study: 43 (47%) in group 1 and 48 (53%) in group 2. In group 1, the longer the protrusion of M1 was, the higher the probability for reulceration (P < .001, 95% confidence interval = 0.813-0.997). In group 2, the shorter the protrusion of M1, the higher the probability for reulceration (P = .002, 95% confidence interval = 0.628-0.905). The optimal cutoff point for group 1 was 11 mm (sensitivity = 84.6%, specificity = 86.7%) for the probability of reulceration. In group 2, it was -7 mm (sensitivity = 81.8%, specificity = 65.4%). These results suggest that M1 protrusion is an optimum prognostic indicator for reulceration and could be recommended for detecting patients at risk of reulceration after surgery.",

        "a": "The expertise to recognize and manage the difficult airway is essential in anesthesiology. Conventionally, this refers to anatomical concerns causing difficulties with facemask ventilation and/or with tracheal intubation. Severe derangements in patients' physiology can make induction and intubation likewise difficult, and approximately 30% of critically ill patients had cardiovascular collapse subsequently to intubation. We present the case of a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of type II diabetes and hypertension who presented with altered mental status due to severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.8 on admission to the intensive care unit. The anesthesia team was called to urgently intubate the patient. Upon arrival, the patient was localizing to pain and was hypocapnic, tachycardic, and hypotensive despite ongoing therapy with norepinephrine, vasopressin, and bicarbonate drips. Bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed hyperdynamic left ventricle with no other abnormalities. The patient was induced with IV ketamine, and dissociation occurred with maintenance of spontaneous respirations, which was followed by laryngoscopy and intubation causing only minimal hemodynamic changes. The patient was subsequently dialyzed and treated supportively. He was discharged from the hospital two weeks later-neurologically intact and at his baseline. Combination of hypotension and severe metabolic acidosis is particularly a challenging setting for airway management and a major risk factor for adverse events, including cardiopulmonary arrest. Hemodynamically stable induction agents should be preferred. In addition, sustaining spontaneous ventilation and avoiding periods of apnea in the peri-intubation period is paramount-any buildup of CO2 could push a critically low pH even lower and cause cardiovascular collapse. Sympathomimetic properties of ketamine make this induction agent a particularly appealing choice in this setting. This case report further supports the concept that severe physiologic perturbations-in which conventional induction techniques are not feasible-should be included in the current definition of a difficult airway.",

Ventilator-associated pneumonia, tracheal injury, and equipment malfunction account for common complications of prolonged ventilation, and respiratory infections are the most common cause of death in spinal cord-injured patients. The development of functional electric stimulation (FES) as an alternative to mechanical ventilation has been motivated by a goal to improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

There are few data on the proportion of Canadian adults vaccinated with Tdap; however, anecdotal reports indicate that uptake is low. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of Canadian health care providers (HCPs) in an attempt to identify potential barriers and facilitators to Tdap uptake. HCPs were surveyed and a geographic and practice representative sample was obtained (N =1,167). In addition, 8 focus groups and 4 interviews were conducted nationwide. Results from the survey indicate that less than half (47.5%) of all respondents reported being immunized with Tdap themselves, while 58.5% routinely offer Tdap to their adult patients. Knowledge scores were relatively low (63.2% correct answers). The best predictor of following the adult Tdap immunization guidelines was awareness of and agreement with those recommendations. Respondents who were aware of the recommendations were more likely to think that Tdap is safe and effective, that their patients are at significant risk of getting pertussis, and to feel that they have sufficient information (p < 0.0001 for each statement). Focus group data supported the survey results and indicated that there are substantial gaps in knowledge of pertussis and Tdap among Canadian HCPs. Lack of public knowledge about adult immunization, lack of immunization registries, a costing differential between Td and Tdap, workload required to deliver the vaccine, and vaccine hesitancy were identified as barriers to compliance with the national recommendations for universal adult immunization, and suggestions were provided to better translate recommendations to front-line practitioners.",

The purpose of this systematic review is to report the patient outcomes, complications, and implant survival of delayed THA for patients with PTA following acetabular fracture. Methods: A systematic review was performed in December 2021 as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Guidelines to identify all studies reporting outcomes of delayed THA performed for PTA with a history of acetabular fracture. From an initial screen of 893 studies, 29 studies which met defined inclusion criteria including minimum 12 months of follow-up and minimum 10 THA were included in the final review. Results: A total of 1220 THA were reported across 29 studies, with 1174 THA completing a minimum of 1-year follow-up at a mean of 86 months. All 29 studies reported upon complications, with a control included in 6 for comparison. Higher complication rates were observed both in patients who had prior open reduction internal fixation and conservative treatment, most notably infection which was observed following 3.6% THA. The total joint revision rate was 9.7%. An improvement was noted in all 25 studies which recorded patient-reported outcomes, with a mean rise in the Harris hip score from 45 to 86 across 18 studies. Conclusions: THA may reduce reported pain levels and improve functional outcomes in selected patients experiencing PTA following acetabular fractures. There is an increased risk of complications, necessitating careful consideration when planning the operation and open discussion with prospective patients and caregivers.",

This systematic literature review sought to understand whether hospital capacity strain is associated with worse health outcomes for hospitalized patients and to evaluate benefits and harms of health system interventions to improve care quality during times of hospital capacity strain. METHODS: Parallel searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists from 1999-2015. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility. We included English-language studies describing the association between capacity strain (high census, acuity, turnover, or an indirect measure of strain such as delayed admission) and health outcomes or intermediate outcomes for children and adults hospitalized in highly developed countries. We also included studies of health system interventions to improve care during times of capacity strain. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Score for observational studies and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for experimental studies. RESULTS: Of 5,702 potentially relevant studies, we included 44 observational and 8 experimental studies. There was marked heterogeneity in the metrics used to define capacity strain, hospital settings, and overall study quality. Mortality increased during times of capacity strain in 18 of 30 studies and in 9 of 12 studies in intensive care unit settings. No experimental studies were randomized, and none demonstrated an improvement in health outcomes after implementing the intervention. The pediatric literature is very limited; only six observational studies included children. There was insufficient study homogeneity to perform meta-analyses. DISCUSSION: In highly developed countries, hospital capacity strain is associated with increased mortality and worsened health outcomes. Evidence-based solutions to improve outcomes during times of capacity strain are needed.",

        "a": "There is incontrovertible evidence that association of type 2 diabetes with hypertension markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, death, and nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, even blood pressure values usually considered below the threshold for hypertension (ie, 140/90 mm Hg) in nondiabetic subjects represent an additional risk of clinical relevance. Evidence that more intensive blood pressure lowering is beneficial in type 2 diabetes over less intensive lowering is also overwhelming. However, most published trials show the need for combination therapy in the great majority of patients, and even with combination therapy it is difficult to attain the expected goal blood pressure, in particular goal systolic blood pressure. It should be recognized that the systolic blood pressure goal of less than 130 mm Hg is a very difficult one to achieve in diabetics. Evidence of the superiority or inferiority of different drug classes is vague and contradictory. Recent evidence concerning angiotensin II receptor antagonists has shown a significant reduction of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and total mortality when losartan was compared with atenolol, but not when irbesartan was compared with amlodipine. If renal endpoints are considered, evidence of the benefit of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in type 2 diabetes is more robust than that available with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of the perineal-to-skull measurement by tranperineal ultrasound (TPU) on the outcome of vaginal operative extraction together with maternal and fetal morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric and descriptive study was done on 272\u00a0patients, from 2009 January 1st to 2009 December 31st. It compares the failure rate of instrumental extraction, total caesarean section rate together with the maternal morbidity (type of perineal tears and post-partum hemorrhage rate) and fetal morbidity (5' Apgar score, arterial pH, transfer in neonatal intensive care unit) to the values obtained with TPU. RESULTS: There is a correlation between the perineal-to-skull measurements higher or equal to 50mm at TPU and the instrumental failure rate (<50mm 0.8% vs. \u226550mm 11.9%; P<0.0001), caesarean (0.9% vs. 33.3%; P<0.0001), post-partum haemorrhage (3% vs. 11.9%; P=0.02), et paediatric intervention (16.7% vs. 31%; P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Perineal-to-skull distance measured with TPU higher or equal to 50mm is at risk of instrumental failure and maternal morbidity. Associated with clinical examination and usual obstetrical risk factors, TPU could be useful to the decision between operative vaginal delivery and prophylactic caesarean section.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Many hospitalized older adults experience delirium, but treatment options are limited. Acupuncture has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce agitation in dementia. We hypothesize that acupuncture, when compared with a sham intervention, will reduce the duration and severity of delirium, normalize delirium biomarkers, and improve clinical outcomes related to delirium in acutely hospitalized older adults with a medical illness. METHODS: This three-arm, prospective, randomized, clinical trial will evaluate adults aged over 65 years who are acutely hospitalized to an internal-medicine ward and diagnosed with delirium or subsyndromal delirium. The 288 patients (96 in each of three groups) will be randomly allocated to receive either daily true acupuncture with usual care, a daily sham procedure with usual care, or usual care only in a 1:1:1 distribution for up to one week or until the patient is delirium-free for over 48\u202fh. Other delirium and clinical interventions will remain unchanged. Delirium will be diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria and its severity will be assessed using the long Confusion Assessment Method Severity (CAM-S) tool. OUTCOMES: The primary study outcome will be the daily CAM-S score over 7 days between the three groups. Secondary outcomes will include time to first resolution of the delirium (over 7 days), the proportion of days spent delirium-free, daily antipsychotic use, daily pain scores, sleep quality, morning serum cortisol and T3 levels, and midnight urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio, all determined twice a week, and delirium-related complications. Hospital mortality, duration of hospital stay and functional status at discharge will also be compared between the three groups. Adverse events potentially related to acupuncture will be evaluated daily. The cost-effectiveness of acupuncture will be estimated. CONCLUSION: This novel randomized study will evaluate both the specific and the non-specific effects of acupuncture on delirium, and related outcomes, and its safety. Potential mechanism(s) of action for acupuncture in reducing delirium will be explored and healthcare-related costs estimated. Positive study results may prove pivotal in facilitating a multimodal, non-pharmacologic, integrative approach to delirium treatment among older, medical inpatients.",

        "a": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of hospitalization and mortality in the United States. Prevention of TB transmission in acute care facilities relies on prompt identification and implementation of airborne isolation, rapid diagnosis, and treatment of presumptive pulmonary TB patients. In areas with low TB burden, this strategy may result in inefficient utilization of airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs). We reviewed TB epidemiology and diagnostic approaches to inform optimal TB detection in low-burden settings. Published clinical prediction rules for individual studies have a sensitivity ranging from 81% to 100% and specificity ranging from 14% to 63% for detection of culture-positive pulmonary TB patients admitted to acute care facilities. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have a specificity of >98%, and the sensitivity of NAATs varies by acid-fast bacilli sputum smear status (positive smear, \u226595%; negative smear, 50%-70%). We propose an infection prevention strategy using a clinical prediction rule to identify patients who warrant diagnostic evaluation for TB in an AIIR with an NAAT. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether use of clinical prediction rules and NAATs results in optimized utilization of AIIRs and improved detection and treatment of presumptive pulmonary TB patients.",

Recent studies showed that its level correlates with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of serum HBsAg and HBcrAg levels at baseline to predict HCC. METHODS: 1400 CHB patients who received nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) treatment since December 2005 were included. Their stored serum samples at baseline were retrieved to measure HBsAg and HBcrAg levels. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of HCC. RESULTS: 85 (6.1%) patients developed HCC during a mean (\u00b1\u2009SD) follow-up duration of 45\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u00a0months.

        "a": "We evaluated the effect of high versus low loading doses of clopidogrel in patients with stable angina pectoris who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on periprocedural events, in-hospital complications, and 30-day outcomes. The recommended loading dose of clopidogrel for patients with PCI is currently 300 mg. Recent studies have suggested that 600 mg may decrease periprocedural complications in patients with unstable angina. However, whether this holds for patients with stable angina pectoris is unknown. We reviewed records of 445 patients with stable angina pectoris who underwent PCI and were loaded with 300 mg (n = 126) or 600 mg (n = 319) of clopidogrel immediately before the procedure. Study end points were periprocedural ischemic events, bleeding complications, and a composite of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days. Baseline characteristics and procedural indexes were similar between groups. Major in-hospital complications were recorded in 2 patients in the 600-mg group and in no patient in the 300-mg group (p = 1.00). Postprocedural increase of cardiac enzymes (troponin I, p = 0.91; creatinine kinase-MB, p = 0.395) and major bleeding (0.6% vs 0%, p = 1.00) were comparable, as was 30-day major adverse cardiac events (1.2% vs 0%, p = 0.56). Multivariate analysis did not identify any risk decrease for periprocedural myocardial infarction with 600 mg of clopidogrel (odds ratio 2.68, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 9.78, p = 0.135). In conclusion, in patients with stable angina pectoris, a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose, when given immediately before PCI, is sufficient. Although 600 mg was clinically safe, it was not associated with fewer periprocedural events and improved 30-day outcomes compared with 300 mg.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes of patients receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare metal stents (BMS) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of saphenous vein bypass grafts (SVG). BACKGROUND: Long-term benefits of DES versus BMS are well established for native vessel PCI. Benefit in patients undergoing SVG intervention is less certain. We used data from a multicenter registry (evaluation of drug eluting stents and ischemic events, EVENT) to compare outcomes among patients treated with DES versus BMS 1-year following SVG interventions. METHODS: Between July 2004 and December 2007, 684 patients in EVENT underwent SVG PCI (515 DES only, 169 BMS only). The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization between hospital discharge and 1-year follow-up. Propensity score stratification was used to adjust for differences between groups. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated with DES and BMS were similar. The DES group had fewer men and a higher prevalence of prior PCI. Patients receiving DES had less angiographic thrombus, less frequent use of embolic protection devices, greater total stent length, and smaller maximum stent diameters. Unadjusted outcomes between discharge and 1-year follow-up did not differ between the groups. After risk adjustment, the primary outcome was less frequent among patients treated with DES (adjusted HR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27-0.84, P < 0.01) with similar relative benefits across the individual endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing SVG PCI in a \"real world\" registry analyzed using propensity score stratification, treatment with DES compared with BMS was associated with reduced MACE at 1 year following PCI.",

We aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of AKI in patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU in Norway. DESIGN: Nation-wide observational study with data sampled from the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry (NIPaR) for the period between 10 March until 31 December 2020. SETTING: ICU patients with COVID-19 in Norway. NIPaR collects data on intensive care stays covering more than 90% of Norwegian ICU and 98% of ICU stays. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Norwegian ICU were included in the study. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were excluded in order to avoid bias from CKD on the incidence of AKI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was AKI at ICU admission as defined by renal Simplified Acute Physiology Score in NIPaR. Secondary outcome measures included survival at 30 and 90 days after admission to hospital. RESULTS: A total number of 361 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. AKI was present in 32.0% of the patients at ICU admission. The risk for AKI at ICU admission was related to acute circulatory failure at admission to hospital. Survival for the study population at 30 and 90 days was 82.5% and 77.6%, respectively. Cancer was a predictor of 30-day mortality. Age, acute circulatory failure at hospital admission and AKI at ICU admission were predictors of both 30-day and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A high number of patients with COVID-19 had AKI at ICU admission. The study indicates that AKI at ICU admission was related to acute circulatory failure at hospital admission.

However, pivotal trial populations were not representative of the real-world population in New Zealand. Real-world treatment effectiveness studies help evaluate the value of public pharmaceutical expenditure. AIM: To determine the survival outcomes of New Zealand patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. METHODS: This is a national retrospective cohort study. Patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received publicly funded immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) from 2017 to 2019 were included. Individual patient data were extracted from national administrative databases. The primary endpoint was OS, and secondary endpoints included OS by age, duration of treatment, posttreatment survival, and 30-day mortality from last pharmaceutical claim. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-seven patients were included, with a median follow-up of 25 months. One-year OS was 72%, the 2-year OS estimate was 60%, and median OS not reached. Survival did not differ by dichotomized age (\u226570 vs. <70 year old), hazard ratio (HR) .94 (95% confidence interval (CI): .72-1.22; p = .62). Median duration of treatment was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.9-10.1). Median post-treatment survival for the subgroup who had ceased treatment was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.0-14.0). For the sample as a whole, the estimated 30-day mortality from last pharmaceutical claim was 15.7%. CONCLUSION: OS in our New Zealand real-world population is comparable to pivotal clinical trials and real-world data (RWD) from other countries. These findings support the achievement of health gains from use of ICI in advanced unresectable and metastatic melanoma.",

This study conducted a meta-analysis of related literature, aiming at comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of two analgesic methods, and providing scientific evidence-based basis for clinical choice of analgesic methods. Methods: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, CNKI, China Biomedical Resources Database, Wanfang Database, VIP, and Foreign Medical Journal Full-Text Service were searched. Keywords were as follows: thoracic epidural block (TEB), paravertebral blockade (PVB), paravertebral catheterization, thoracotomy, and analgesia. Two professionals independently screened documents and extracted data, and used Cochrane System Evaluator Manual (version 5.1.0) to repeatedly assess the bias risk of the documents included in the study. Results: A total of 9 articles were included. Of the 9 RCTs in the present study, 5 described the allocation concealment in detail, 9 described the correct random allocation method, and 1 did not use the blind method.

The fixed-effects model was used to analyze the incidence of hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention. The results showed that there was significant difference between the PVB group and TEB group [hypotension: relative risk (RR): 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.46, P=0.0006; nausea: RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25-0.66, P=0.0002; vomiting: RR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.06-0.87, P=0.03; urinary retention: RR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87, P=0.02]. Discussion: The meta-analysis confirmed that PVB has the same analgesic effect and postoperative pulmonary function as epidural blockade in open thoracotomy lung surgery.

METHODS: Anaerobic threshold and VE/VCO(2) slope, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and the echocardiographic markers left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left atrial (LA) diameter were measured in 62 patients with heart failure (HF), who also completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF), and the Specific Activity Questionnaire (SAQ). Linear regression models, adjusting for age and gender, were fitted. RESULTS: While the etiology of HF, SAQ score, MLHF score, LVEF, LA diameter, and logNT-proBNP were each significantly predictive of both AT and VE/VCO2 slope on stepwise multiple linear regression, only SAQ score (P < .001) and logNT-proBNP (P = .001) were significantly predictive of AT, explaining 56% of the variability (adjusted R(2) = 0.525), while logNT-proBNP (P < .001) and etiology of HF (P = .003) were significantly predictive of VE/VCO(2) slope, explaining 49% of the variability (adjusted R(2) = 0.45). The area under the ROC curve for NT-proBNP to identify patients with a VE/VCO(2) slope greater than 34 and AT less than 11 mL \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1) was 0.797; P < .001 and 0.712; P = .044, respectively. A plasma concentration greater than 429.5 pg/mL (sensitivity: 78%; specificity: 70%) and greater than 674.5 pg/mL (sensitivity: 77.8%; specificity: 65%) identified a VE/VCO(2) slope greater than 34 and AT lower than 11 mL \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1), respectively.

In recent years, there has been interest in attempting to reduce this surgical morbidity by adopting a number of minimally invasive approaches. METHODS: Fifteen patients with pancreatic necrosis underwent pancreatic necrosectomy by minimally invasive surgery (11 men, 4 women; age group: 25-64 years, mean age: 46 years). Apache II scores ranged from 5 to 14. Pancreatic necrosectomy was performed by laparoscopic transperitoneal approach in 12 patients (transmesocolic, 4 patients; transgastrocolic, 6 patients; and gastrohepatic omentum, 2 patients), by retroperitoneal approach in 2 patients, and by a combination of methods in 1 patient (endoscopic transgastric drainage followed by laparoscopic intracavity necrosectomy). Relook laparoscopy was done in 5 patients to assess for residual necrosis. RESULTS: All the patients tolerated the procedure well, and there was no mortality. Two of them had pancreatic fistula, which eventually responded to conservative treatment. Three patients were converted to open necrosectomy because of bleeding or difficulty to access the area of necrosis. The mean operating time was 120\u2009\u00b1\u200910 minutes. There were no postoperative complications related to the procedure itself, such as major wound infections, intestinal fistulae, or postoperative hemorrhage. Postoperative computed tomographic scans confirmed adequacy of debridement. The average length of hospital stay after surgery was 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive necrosectomy is technically feasible and a body of evidence now suggests that acceptable outcomes can be achieved.

Blips, defined as intermittent episodes of detectable low-level HIV viremia, may be an indication of poor adherence to HAART. OBJECTIVES: To (a) determine the influence of adding anti-HCV therapy to HAART on complexity index, adherence, and incidence of blips and (b) determine complexity index and adherence in patient subgroups based on anti-HCV therapy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 2-center observational study.

The complexity index was based on a score that utilized the number of pills per day, dosing schedule, dosage form, and any specific instructions linked to use of the drug. Blips were defined as a detectable HIV-RNA level ( greater than\u200950 copies/mL but no more than 1,000 copies/mL) occurring between 2 negative assays. Medication adherence was assessed using electronic pharmacy refill records. The threshold for optimal adherence was defined at 95% and above. Differences in the variables collected were assessed before and after the addition of anti-HCV therapy to HAART.R ESULTS: A total of 66 patients were included in the study. Based on the complexity index, the median value before and after the addition of anti-HCV therapy to HAART was 4.2 (interquartile range [IQR]\u2009=\u20093.5-5.5) and 11.5 (IQR\u2009=\u200910.4-13.4), respectively. The median difference between both complexity indices was 6.9 (95% CI\u2009=\u20096.9-7, P\u2009 less than \u20090.001). After introducing the anti-HCV therapy into HAART, the number of adherent patients decreased from 50 (75.8%) to 45 (68.2%, P\u2009 greater than\u20090.05), and 12 (18.2%) patients presented blips (P\u2009 less than \u20090.001). Subgroup analysis based on anti-HCV therapy showed that patients on boceprevir or telaprevir therapy had a higher complexity index, 16.8 (IQR\u2009=\u20096.0-18.4), compared with patients on bi-therapy anti-HCV, 11.3 (IQR\u2009=\u200910.3-12). The median difference was 6.0 (95% CI\u2009=\u20095.0-7.2, P\u2009 less than \u20090.001). The number of adherent patients decreased only in patients on bi-therapy from 42 (79.2%) to 37 (69.8%, P\u2009 greater than\u20090.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adding anti-HCV therapy to antiretroviral treatment significantly increases treatment complexity and the incidence of blips. The introduction of anti-HCV therapy is also associated with a decrease in the number of adherent patients. The regimen complexity calculation may be useful for identifying patients who need more care from health care professionals or are at risk for failure to comply with treatment regimens.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The probable stability of the lesion is critical in guiding treatment decisions in unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs). The authors aimed to develop multidimensional predictive models for the stability of unruptured IAs. METHODS: Patients with unruptured IAs in the anterior circulation were prospectively enrolled and regularly followed up. Clinical data were collected, IA morphological features were assessed, and adjacent hemodynamic features were quantified with patient-specific computational fluid dynamics modeling. Based on multivariate logistic regression analyses, nomograms incorporating these factors were developed in a primary cohort (patients enrolled between January 2017 and February 2018) to predict aneurysm rupture or growth within 2 years. The predictive accuracies of the nomograms were compared with the population, hypertension, age, size, earlier rupture, and site (PHASES) and earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, location, age, population, size, and shape (ELAPSS) scores and validated in the validation cohort (patients enrolled between March and October 2018). RESULTS: Among 231 patients with 272 unruptured IAs in the primary cohort, hypertension, aneurysm location, irregular shape, size ratio, normalized wall shear stress average, and relative resident time were independently related to the 2-year stability of unruptured IAs. The nomogram including clinical, morphological, and hemodynamic features (C+M+H nomogram) had the highest predictive accuracy (c-statistic 0.94), followed by the nomogram including clinical and morphological features (C+M nomogram; c-statistic 0.89), PHASES score (c-statistic 0.68), and ELAPSS score (c-statistic 0.58). Similarly, the C+M+H nomogram had the highest predictive accuracy (c-statistic 0.94) in the validation cohort (85 patients with 97 unruptured IAs). CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamics have predictive values for 2-year stability of unruptured IAs treated conservatively. Multidimensional nomograms have significantly higher predictive accuracies than conventional risk prediction scores.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Apolipoprotein A1 (A1) and haptoglobin (HP) serum levels are associated with the spread and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We have constructed and validated a multivariable risk calculator (A1HPV6) integrating A1, HP, alpha2-macroglobulin, and gamma glutamyl transferase to improve the performances of virological biomarkers. METHODS: In a prospective observational study of hospitalized patients with nonsevere SARS-CoV-2 infection, A1HPV6 was constructed in 127 patients and validated in 116. The specificity was assessed in 7482 controls representing the general population. The primary diagnostic endpoint was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The primary prognostic endpoint was the age-and sex-adjusted risk of A1HPV6 to predict patients with WHO-stage > 4 (W > 4) severity. We assessed the kinetics of the A1HPV6 components in a nonhuman primate model (NHP), from baseline to 7 days (D7) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for A1HPV6 was 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in the validation subset, which was not significantly different from that in the construction subset, 0.99 (0.99-0.99; P\u00a0= .80), like for sensitivity 92% (85-96) vs 94% (88-97; P\u00a0= .29). A1HPV6 was associated with W > 4, with a significant odds ratio of 1.3 (1.1-1.5; 0.002). In NHP, A1 levels decreased (P < .01) at D2 and normalized at D4; HP levels increased at D2 and peaked at D4. In patients, A1 concentration was very low at D2 vs controls (P < .01) and increased at D14 (P < .01) but was still lower than controls; HP increased at D2 and remained elevated at D14. CONCLUSION: These results validate the diagnostic and prognostic performances of A1HPV6. Similar kinetics of apolipoprotein A1, HP, and alpha-2-macroglobulin were observed in the NHP model.

        "a": "CONTEXT: Nicorandil is an antianginal drug used for 20 years in Japan and introduced in France in 1994. Since 1997, side effects such as mucocutaneous ulcerations have regularly been reported. OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case of a patient with a spontaneous corneal perforation associated with mucocutaneous ulcerations while taking Nicorandil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 81-year-old patient, with no past history of ocular disease but a long past history of cardiovascular disease, presented with a spontaneous paracentral corneal perforation. This was consecutive to 5 months of recurrent keratoconjunctivitis and mucocutaneous ulcerations resistant to conventional therapy. (He was taking nicorandil for 5 years.) A penetrating keratoplasty was performed in emergency. RESULTS: Inflammatory and infectious causes of spontaneous corneal perforation were ruled out. After initial uneventful post-operative wound healing, an epithelial ulcer appeared on the graft. Dermatologists suggested the iatrogenic role of nicorandil and the drug was discontinued. Both mucocutaneous and corneal ulcerations resolved rapidly. DISCUSSION: Although mucocutaneous ulcerations have been attributed several times to nicorandil, this is, to our knowledge, the first major corneal damage due to this antianginal drug. Timing, pattern of illness, absence of other aetiology, recurrence of epithelial ulceration on the corneal graft and its spontaneous healing after nicorandil discontinuation make it highly apparent probable that nicorandil was directly involved in this corneal perforation. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists and dermatologists should be aware of the risk of severe but reversible corneal ulcerations in patients treated with nicorandil. A pharmacovigilance warning statement should be compulsory.",

        "a": "Vitamin D(3) is a neurosteroid that mediates its effects via the vitamin D receptor (VDR).  The VDR gene is located on chromosome 12q13 and consists of 9 exons.  VDR contains the DNA-binding site encoded by exons 2 and 3 and the ligand-binding site encoded by exons 4 - 9.  Our earlier study showed that the ApaI polymorphic site of the VDR gene is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Here, we investigated the association between additional polymorphisms of the VDR gene and AD using the same samples.  Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 8 (BsmI and Tru9I polymorphisms) and one in exon 2 (FokI polymorphism) of the VDR gene were examined in up to 108 AD patients and 115 age-matched controls.  Genotypes were determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods.  Haplotype analysis also included the previously studied polymorphic sites that were recognized by TaqI (in exon 9) and ApaI (in intron 8) restriction enzymes.  There was no significant difference between AD patients and controls when their genotypes for BsmI, Tru9I and FokI polymorphic sites were compared.  However, the frequency of \"TaubF\" haplotype (alleles of TaqI, ApaI, Tru9I, BsmI and FokI, respectively), which was determined by analyzing 5 polymorphisms together, was significantly higher in the AD patient group, suggesting that this haplotype is a risk factor in AD.  Our results point out a possible link between AD and certain VDR polymorphisms and indicate that individuals with these polymorphisms might be vulnerable to AD.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Respiratory complications are most common cause of morbidity/mortality in patients with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) due to respiratory muscle weakness and lower diaphragm position resulting in limited availability of inspiration, reduced thorax mobility and limited forced expiration. Differences in respiratory dysfunctions (RDs) in patients with motor complete versus incomplete cSCI were assessed. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study, serial measurement. SETTING: University hospital and ambulatory departments. METHODS: Twenty two patients with acute cSCI were recruited. Neurological level of injury and severity according to ISNCSCI were used as criteria for recruitment. Patients were divided into two groups - motor complete and incomplete. Standardized pulmonary function tests (PFT) were used - spirometry and respiratory muscle strength (RMS) measurement. Motor score of key muscles assessments for upper (UEMS) and lower (LEMS) limbs were used. Tests were performed in 5 measurement sessions starting on (medians) 14.5 days (M1), then 6.7 weeks, 3.2 months, 6.3 months and 1.0 year (M5). RESULTS: Significant differences in measurement sessions M2-M5 between groups in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), maximal static inspiratory/expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP) and UEMS were proved. Consequently, prominent differences in courses of particular parameters were found. No intergroup changes in UEMS were found during study. CONCLUSIONS: Obvious differences in parameters of spirometry, respiratory muscles and limb muscles strength between motor complete and incomplete group were found. Carefull monitoring of RDs by functional assessments (i.e., PFT and UEMS/LEMS tests) within one year after SCI seems to be clinically important.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Several studies have examined the rates of depression in caregivers of patients with debilitating neurologic diseases. This study describes the degree of burden and the prevalence of depression among individuals caring for legally blind patients. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies in the ophthalmic literature have reported this relationship. DESIGN: Clinic-based, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: We included 522 individuals in Rampur, India, providing care to their close family relatives who were legally blind. Visual acuities varied from 20/200 in the best eye, to no light perception (NLP) in each eye. METHODS: Several surveys were completed by the caregivers of patients whose sole impairment was visual, allowing us to quantitatively and selectively assess burden and depression among caregivers of blind patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Burden Index of Caregivers (BIC) was used to measure care burden and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was applied to determine depression. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with NLP experience higher burden than caregivers of patients with lesser degrees of blindness. Daily hours spent on close supervision and the intensity of care-giving were the definitive factors linked to high BIC scores (P<0.01). The prevalence of caregiver depression increased with degree of visual impairment from 16% in the 20/200 group to 48% in the NLP cohort (P<0.01). Independently related variables for depression in caregivers were daily hours required for close supervision of the patient, intensity of care-giving, low household income, and the caregiver being the parent of a blind adult child (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Severity of blindness in patients directly correlated with burden in caregivers. More severe forms of blindness meant patients require more help with their activities of daily living and additional hours of close supervision per day, both of which increase care burden. The same 2 factors also increase risk of caregiver depression along with low household income and the caregiver being the parent of a blind adult child. Awareness of the extent of burden and depression among caregivers of blind individuals is required by vision health personnel to identify at risk caregivers and implement effective interventions and support strategies.",

        "a": "Background: The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of different nutritional parameters in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent surgical resection. Methods: A total of 620 patients with ESCC who underwent esophagectomy were analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to set the appropriate cutoff points for five nutritional parameters: serum albumin (SA), body mass index (BMI), geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and a new modified nutritional risk index (mNRI). Survival analyses were performed to calculate overall survival and investigate the independent prognostic factors. Results: The median preoperative BMI, SA, GNRI, PNI, and mNRI values were 20.90, 42.75, 102.95, 51.90, and 63.90, respectively. The corresponding optimal cutoff points were 18.75 for BMI, 43.05 for SA, 98.5 for GNRI, 51.45 for PNI, and 61.45 for mNRI. All nutritional parameters were significantly correlated with tumor length and pT category. Decreased nutritional parameters were significantly correlated with poor survival in univariate analysis; however, only the mNRI was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.041). Conclusions: Nutritional parameters are convenient and valuable prognostic factors in ESCC patients who undergo surgical resection. The new mNRI parameter may be superior to the other nutritional parameters.",

There is uncertainty about who will benefit from it. OBJECTIVE: To explore the predicting factors for good outcome in patients with ASPECTS <6 treated with EVT. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 60 patients with ASPECTS <6 treated with EVT in our center between March 2018 and June 2019. Patients were divided into 2 groups because of the modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 d: good outcome group (mRS 0-2) and poor outcome group (mRS \u22653). Baseline and procedural characteristics were collected for unilateral variate and multivariate regression analyses to explore the influent variates for good outcome. RESULTS: Good outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 24 (40%) patients after EVT and mortality was 20% for 90 d. Compared with the poor outcome group, higher baseline cortical ASPECTS (c-ASPECTS), lower intracranial hemorrhage, and malignant brain edema after thrombectomy were noted in the good outcome group (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that only baseline c-ASPECTS (\u22653) was positive factor for good outcome (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a04.29; 95% CI, 1.21-15.20; P\u00a0=\u00a0.024). The receiver operating characteristics curve indicated a moderate value of c-ASPECTS for predicting good outcome, with the area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.83; P\u00a0=\u00a0.011). CONCLUSION: Higher baseline c-ASPECTS was a predictor for good clinical outcome in patients with ASPECTS <6 treated with EVT, which could be helpful to treatment decision.",

The oxygen consumption at the ventilatory threshold (VT) has also been shown to be prognostic. However, the VT cannot always be detected in patients with HF. Other variables such as the difference between peak oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption at the VT (termed the functional aerobic reserve [FAR]) may also provide prognostic information. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of an undetectable VT and FAR. METHODS: Eight hundred seventy-four patients with chronic, systolic HF (70% male, age 54 \u00b1 14 years, ejection fraction 29% \u00b1 12%) underwent CPX and were tracked for 2 years for major events (death, transplant, and left ventricular assist device implantation). RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 subgroups based on whether VT could be detected or not. There were 141 major events during the 2-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis for the 2 VT subgroups demonstrated worse prognoses for patients with a nondetectable VT versus those with a detectable VT (P < .001). Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (FAR = 0 mlO\u2082 kg\u207b\u00b9 min\u207b\u00b9 for patients with undetectable VT), the optimal cut-point for FAR was \u2264/>3 mlO\u2082 kg min\u207b\u00b9 (sensitivity/specificity 69%/60%). Cox regression analysis identified the FAR as a significant univariate predictor of risk and was retained in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data reveal that an undetectable VT and the FAR during CPX testing can provide useful prognostic information in patients with HF.",

DESIGN: Open randomised trial. METHOD: In the period September 2001-February 2004, 598 patients, aged > 50 years, with acute herpes zoster (rash for < 7 days) below dermatome C6, were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (oral antiviral agents and analgesics) alone or standard therapy plus an additional single epidural injection of 80 mg methylprednisolone and 10 mg bupivacaine. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with zoster-associated pain one month after inclusion. The presence and severity of zoster-associated pain at other time points were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: At one month, pain was reported by 137 (48%) patients in the injection group versus 164 (58%) in the control group (relative risk; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.97; p = 0.02). After three months, these values were 58 (21%) and 63 (24%), respectively (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.65-1-21; p = 0.47), and at 6 months: 39 (15%) and 44 (17%) (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57-1-13; p = 0.43). No subgroups were detectable in which the relative risk for pain at one month after inclusion substantially differed from the overall estimate. At one month, the median severity of pain in the injection group was 2 (on a 100-points scale) versus 6 in the control group (p = 0.02). At later follow-up, there was no longer any statistically significant difference in the severity of pain between the two groups. No patient had major adverse events related to the epidural injection. CONCLUSION: A single epidural injection of steroids and local anaesthetics in the acute phase of herpes zoster resulted in a modest decrease in zoster-associated pain in the first month.

Length of hospital stay, weight loss, disease complications, and nutritional support were recorded. RESULTS: PNSS consisted of three elements: disease with malnutrition risks, changes in food intake, and anthropometric measurements, with a score of 0-2 for each element. The optimal cut-off score to identify patients (n=96) at risk of undernutrition was two. The agreement between PNSS and the complete dietetic assessment was moderate (\u03ba=0.435, 95% CI=0.373-0.498). Sensitivity and specificity values of PNSS were 82% (95% CI=76%-87%) and 71% (95% CI=67%-74%), respectively. Inter-rater agreement had a \u03ba value of 0.596 (95% CI=0.529-0.664, p<0.001). The percentage of children with undernutrition risk was 44.9%. Children with oncologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac diseases were most likely to be at risk of undernutrition. The at-risk group was associated significantly with longer length of hospital stay and higher percentage of weight loss compared with the not-at-risk group. CONCLUSION: PNSS is the first nutritional screening tool developed for hospitalized children and validated in a large population of patients in China.",

        "a": "RATIONALE: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients undergo several diagnostic and therapeutic procedures every day. The prevalence, intensity, and risk factors of pain related to these procedures are not well known. OBJECTIVES: To assess self-reported procedural pain intensity versus baseline pain, examine pain intensity differences across procedures, and identify risk factors for procedural pain intensity. METHODS: Prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter, multinational study of pain intensity associated with 12 procedures. Data were obtained from 3,851 patients who underwent 4,812 procedures in 192 ICUs in 28 countries. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pain intensity on a 0-10 numeric rating scale increased significantly from baseline pain during all procedures (P < 0.001). Chest tube removal, wound drain removal, and arterial line insertion were the three most painful procedures, with median pain scores of 5 (3-7), 4.5 (2-7), and 4 (2-6), respectively. By multivariate analysis, risk factors independently associated with greater procedural pain intensity were the specific procedure; opioid administration specifically for the procedure; preprocedural pain intensity; preprocedural pain distress; intensity of the worst pain on the same day, before the procedure; and procedure not performed by a nurse. A significant ICU effect was observed, with no visible effect of country because of its absorption by the ICU effect. Some of the risk factors became nonsignificant when each procedure was examined separately. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors for greater procedural pain intensity identified in this study may help clinicians select interventions that are needed to minimize procedural pain. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01070082).",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System (BedsidePEWS) is a clinical decision support tool designed to augment clinician expertise, objectively identify children at risk for clinical deterioration, and standardize and prioritize care to improve outcomes in community settings. Although the paper-based BedsidePEWS documentation record has been shown to improve clinicians' perception of their ability to detect deterioration and follow care recommendations, research is needed to asses this impact empirically. Furthermore, as hospitals progressively move toward electronic clinical systems, knowledge regarding the impact of BedsidePEWS' novel electronic interface on clinicians' performance and user experience is required. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study were (1) to compare adherence to evidence-based care recommendations using a) electronic health record software, b) paper BedsidePEWS, and c) a novel electronic BedsidePEWS interface, and (2) to describe end-users' experiences of usability and opportunities for improvement of both paper and electronic BedsidePEWS. METHODS: Paediatric nurses participated in a repeated measures simulation study. Participants assessed simulated patients, documented patient data, and responded to a series of questions regarding follow-up care for each patient. Three patient types (i.e., stable, mild deterioration, severe deterioration) were assessed in each of three intervention conditions (i.e., electronic health record, paper BedsidePEWS, electronic BedsidePEWS). Following simulation scenarios, participants provided comments regarding the usability of the paper and electronic tools. RESULTS: Participants made 12.7% and 18.0% more appropriate care decisions with paper and electronic BedsidePEWS, respectively, than with the electronic health record intervention (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Accurate BedsidePEWS severity of illness score calculation was related to better adherence to evidence-based care recommendations (65%), compared to inaccurate calculation (55%), and electronic BedsidePEWS was associated with 15.7% fewer calculation errors than paper (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). Electronic BedsidePEWS demonstrated usability benefits over its paper predecessor, including automatic score calculation and data plotting, and the potential to eliminate double charting, and participants expressed a preference for electronic BedsidePEWS in all aspects of the debrief questionnaire (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BedsidePEWS in both paper and electronic formats significantly improved participants' ability to detect deterioration and follow care recommendations compared to electronic health record software. Furthermore, results suggest that electronic BedsidePEWS would afford improved patient care in excess of the paper-based original and further contribute to the standardization, prioritization, and improvement of care in community settings.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: In this cohort study, we explored the relationship between fluid balance, intradialytic hypotension and outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who received renal replacement therapy (RRT). METHODS: We analysed prospectively collected registry data on patients older than 16 years who received RRT for at least two days in an intensive care unit at two university-affiliated hospitals. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the relationship between mean daily fluid balance and intradialytic hypotension, both over seven days following RRT initiation, and the outcomes of hospital mortality and RRT dependence in survivors. RESULTS: In total, 492 patients were included (299 male (60.8%), mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 62.9 (16.3) years); 251 (51.0%) died in hospital. Independent risk factors for mortality were mean daily fluid balance (odds ratio (OR) 1.36 per 1000 mL positive (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.57), intradialytic hypotension (OR 1.14 per 10% increase in days with intradialytic hypotension (95% CI 1.06 to 1.23)), age (OR 1.15 per five-year increase (95% CI 1.07 to 1.25)), maximum sequential organ failure assessment score on days 1 to 7 (OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.29)), and Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.44)); higher baseline creatinine (OR 0.98 per 10 \u03bcmol/L (95% CI 0.97 to 0.996)) was associated with lower risk of death. Of 241 hospital survivors, 61 (25.3%) were RRT dependent at discharge. The only independent risk factor for RRT dependence was pre-existing heart failure (OR 3.13 (95% CI 1.46 to 6.74)). Neither mean daily fluid balance nor intradialytic hypotension was associated with RRT dependence in survivors. Associations between these exposures and mortality were similar in sensitivity analyses accounting for immortal time bias and dichotomising mean daily fluid balance as positive or negative. In the subgroup of patients with data on pre-RRT fluid balance, fluid overload at RRT initiation did not modify the association of mean daily fluid balance with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with AKI requiring RRT, a more positive mean daily fluid balance and intradialytic hypotension were associated with hospital mortality but not with RRT dependence at hospital discharge in survivors.",

        "a": "Purpose: The current tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is inadequate at identifying patients with high-risk colorectal cancer. Using a systematic and comprehensive biomarker discovery and validation approach, we aimed to identify an miRNA recurrence classifier (MRC) that can improve upon the current TNM staging as well as is superior to currently offered molecular assays.Experimental Design: Three independent genome-wide miRNA expression profiling datasets were used for biomarker discovery (N = 158) and in silico validation (N = 109 and N = 40) to identify an miRNA signature for predicting tumor recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer. Subsequently, this signature was analytically trained and validated in retrospectively collected independent patient cohorts of fresh-frozen (N = 127, cohort 1) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE; N = 165, cohort 2 and N = 139, cohort 3) specimens.Results: We identified an 8-miRNA signature that significantly predicted recurrence-free interval (RFI) in the discovery (P = 0.002) and two independent publicly available datasets (P = 0.00006 and P = 0.002). The RT-PCR-based validation in independent clinical cohorts revealed that MRC-derived high-risk patients succumb to significantly poor RFI in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer [cohort 1: hazard ratio (HR), 3.44 (1.56-7.45), P = 0.001; cohort 2: HR, 6.15 (3.33-11.35), P = 0.001; and cohort 3: HR, 4.23 (2.26-7.92), P = 0.0003]. In multivariate analyses, MRC emerged as an independent predictor of tumor recurrence and achieved superior predictive accuracy over the currently available molecular assays. The RT-PCR-based MRC risk score = (-0.1218 \u00d7 miR-744) + (-3.7142 \u00d7 miR-429) + (-2.2051 \u00d7 miR-362) + (3.0564 \u00d7 miR-200b) + (2.4997 \u00d7 miR-191) + (-0.0065 \u00d7 miR-30c2) + (2.2224 \u00d7 miR-30b) + (-1.1162 \u00d7 miR-33a).Conclusions: This novel MRC is superior to currently used clinicopathologic features, as well as National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, and works regardless of adjuvant chemotherapy status in identifying patients with high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer. This can be readily deployed in clinical practice with FFPE specimens for decision-making pending further model testing and validation.

The aim of the study was to find determinants of the household ETS in the sample of pregnant women living in the household with smokers and to assess their physical and mental health. The survey was distributed to women being seen for follow-up at the obstetric/gynecology departments in hospitals and at gynecological out-patient departments in Bratislava, Slovakia. The medical outcomes short form-12 (SF-12) was included to quantify the mental and physical health of mothers. From the total sample of 617 women, 35.5% (219) were pregnant, 88.6% of them (194) non-smokers, 27.8% (54) lived with a smoking partner, the average mental component summary (MCS) score was 50.8\u00b19.1 and physical component summary (PCS) score was 41.6\u00b110.3. The average age was 31.3\u00b15.1 years. In the sample of 309 non-pregnant non-smoking mothers 23% (71) lived with a smoking partner; the average age was 31.7\u00b14.8 years. The average PCS score was 47.8\u00b18.7 and MCS score 49.1\u00b19. Non-smoking, pregnant women living with a smoker have fewer years of education (p=0.0003) and lower MCS scores (48.50\u00b19.8) (p=0.03). Non-smoking, non-pregnant women living with a smoker are older (p=0.0042), with lower income (p=0.0145), have fewer years of education (p=0.002) and lower PCS score (45\u00b19.1) (p=0.0056). Multivariate analyses revealed the decrease of MCS score in pregnant women and the decrease of PCS score in non-pregnant women living with a smoker. Our results show that living with a smoker is independently associated with worse physical and mental health in a selected sample of Slovak women, which represents an important argument for intervention in families.",

        "a": "Early-onset breast cancer (BC) has been recognized to be more aggressive compared with its later counterparts. Survival models of BC in young patients have rarely been reported in previous studies. The current study aimed to establish and validate prediction models with clinicopathological variables for visceral metastasis-free survival (VFS), disease-free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) time in young patients with BC. Clinicopathological data were obtained for 351 patients with primary breast tumors who were \u226440 years old. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed and nomograms were established to screen and illustrate the prognostic factors. Risk scores were calculated based on coefficients from the Cox regression analysis. Internal validation of the prediction models was conducted by predicting the prognosis of cases randomly sampled from the cohort used in the current study. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that N stage (P=0.004), molecular subtype (P=0.007) and age (P=0.005) were significant independent prognostic factors for VFS. Similarly, N stage (P=0.002) and molecular subtype (P=0.001) were significantly associated with DFS. In addition, N stage (P=0.006), molecular subtype (P=0.006) and the presence of an initially inoperable tumor (P=0.005) were significant independent prognostic factors for OS. According to the Cox regression analysis, nomograms were generated to illustrate the effect of independent prognostic factors on VFS, DFS and OS. Risk scores were calculated and internal validation demonstrated the reliability of the prediction models. In conclusion, N stage and molecular subtype were identified as predictors for VFS, DFS and OS in early-onset BC. Furthermore, an age of <35 years at diagnosis was revealed to be unfavorable for VFS and the presence of an initially inoperable tumor was identified to reduce OS time.",

Records of patients having TP from 1997 to 2005 were reviewed. Patient presentation, etiology of disease, and the indication for TP were examined. Operative results were analyzed. Long-term results were critically assessed, including narcotic usage and the need for re-admission. Postoperative quality of life (QOL) was assessed by the SF-36 health survey. During the study period, 7 patients with CP had TP, and 28 had other operations. The etiology of CP was alcohol in four and hereditary pancreatitis in three. The indication for surgery was pain and weight loss. Preoperatively, all patients used narcotics chronically and two had insulin-dependent diabetes. Four had TP after failed previous surgical procedures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography demonstrated small ducts and atrophic calcified glands. The mean length of the operation was 468 minutes, and only two patients required transfusion. There were no biliary anastomotic complications. The mean length of stay was 14 days. Major morbidity was limited to a single patient with a leak from the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Thirty-day mortality was zero, with one late death unrelated to the surgical procedure or diabetes. The mean length of follow-up was 46 months. All patients remained alcohol and narcotic free. No patient was readmitted with a diabetic complication. When compared with the general population, QOL scores were diminished but reasonable. We conclude that TP is indicated in hereditary pancreatitis and in those with an atrophic, calcified pancreas with small duct disease; that TP is technically arduous but can be completed with very low morbidity and mortality; and that on long-term follow-up, pain relief and abstinence from alcohol and narcotics was excellent with an acceptable QOL.",

We hypothesized that SS BLTKA is as safe as TS BLTKA. METHODS: Patients with a minimum follow-up of 12\u00a0months were included in this study. Oxford knee score and quality of life index SF12 was compared between the 2 groups at six weeks and six month follow-up. RESULTS: SS BLTKA included 250 patients and TS BLTKA included 210 patients. The minimum time interval between two operations was three weeks (mean 1.6\u00a0months, range 3\u00a0weeks-12\u00a0months). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in peri-operative mortality, surgical site infection, major peri-operative complications. There was no difference between the 2 groups in the Oxford knee score and quality of life index SF12 at 6-month follow-up. There was no difference in the range of knee flexion between the 2 groups at six months. Post-operative haemoglobin drop was significantly more in SS BLTKA patients and consequently, blood transfusion requirement was significantly higher in SS BLTKA. There was a significantly higher length of hospital stay and duration of surgery in TS BLTKA group. CONCLUSION: There does not appear to be a difference in complication rates between the 2 groups. SS BLTKA seems to be a logical choice if both knees have severe osteoarthritis. Patients with severe cardiopulmonary compromise were excluded, and a unilateral procedure may be preferred in them.",

For this purpose, the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL, Italian Lymphoma Foundation) carried out a multicenter retrospective study on a large consecutive series of patients with hepatitis C virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinical and virological features and to develop a specific prognostic score for this subset of patients. All prognostic evaluations were performed on 535 patients treated with an anthracycline-based induction regimen (with rituximab in 255 cases). Severe hepatotoxicity was observed in 14% of patients. The use of rituximab was not associated with increased rate of severe hepatotoxicity. Three-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 71% and 55%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status of 2 or over, serum albumin below 3.5 g/dL and HCV-RNA viral load over 1000 KIU/mL retained prognostic significance. We combined these 3 factors in a new \"HCV Prognostic Score\" able to discriminate 3 risk categories with different overall and progression-free survival (low=0; intermediate=1; high-risk \u22652 factors; P<0.001). This score retained prognostic value in the subgroups of patients treated with and without rituximab (P<0.001). The new score performed better than the International Prognostic Index at multivariate analysis and Harrel C-statistic. With the use of three readily available factors (performance status, albumin level and HCV-RNA viral load), the new \"HCV Prognostic Score\" is able to identify 3 risk categories with different survival, and may be a useful tool to predict the outcome of hepatitis C virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated disability is the loss of the ability to complete one activity of daily living (ADL), with this decline occurring between the onset of acute illness and discharge from the hospital. Approximately 30% of patients who are >70 years old and admitted to hospitals are discharged with an ADL disability. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) models use a multidimensional, interdisciplinary process of diagnosis and treatment with the goal of improving outcomes and decreasing lengths of stay. METHODS: A retrospective clinical audit of Ipswich Hospital's medical records included patients for random selection who were >75 years of age and had an acute admission to the Older Person Evaluation Review and Assessment (OPERA) or general medicine (GM) service from July 2012 to December 2012. Data were collected for the entire admission period on length of stay, comorbidities, allied health visits, functional ability, and delirium and dementia at admission. RESULTS: Of the 267 patients evaluated, 133 were admitted to the OPERA service, and 134 were admitted to the GM service. Patients admitted to the OPERA service were significantly more ill than patients admitted to the GM service as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (6.53 \u00b1 1.83 vs 6.02 \u00b1 1.96, respectively, P=0.02), Katz Index of Independence in ADL scores (3.77 \u00b1 2.22 vs 4.72 \u00b1 2.00, respectively, P<0.001), presence of delirium at admission (28% vs 15%, respectively, P=0.02), and presence of dementia at admission (42% vs 21%, respectively, P=0.002). However, patients in both groups had a mean acute length of stay of 4 days (P=0.33), the readmission rate was <20% for both groups (P=0.33), and the mortality rate for each group was similar (3%). CONCLUSION: By showing that patients admitted to the OPERA service were more ill than patients admitted to the GM service but health outcomes were maintained, researchers hope to justify the need for such CGA models. Additional goals include garnering support for the maintenance and growth of CGA models; decreasing mortality, cost, and readmission rates; and improving the quality of life for older patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Selective non-operative management (NOM) and diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) are well-accepted approaches in the management of stable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma (PAT). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of early DL in stable asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with PAT as opposed to NOM, a standard of care in this scenario. The secondary aim was to suggest possible indications for DL. METHODS: Patients managed with DL or NOM over a 12-month period were included in this study. The age, gender, mechanism and location of injuries, trauma scores, haemodynamic and metabolic parameters, intraoperative findings and length of hospital stay (LOS) were recorded and correlated with outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were in the NOM group and 35 in the DL group. Stab wounds were more common. The most common location of injury was the anterior abdominal wall in the NOM group and the lower chest in the DL group. Computed tomography (CT) scan was performed more often in the NOM group (75% vs. 17.1%). The injury severity score (ISS), New ISS and PAT Index were higher in the DL group. Nearly 23 (66%) patients in the DL group had a penetration of the peritoneum, but no significant abdominal injuries. LOS in the NOM group was 2 days versus 3.1 days in the DL group. There were no missed injuries, complications or mortality. CONCLUSION: NOM is a preferred modality for minimally symptomatic stable patients. However, there is a risk of missed injuries and delayed treatment. DL accurately visualizes injuries, decreases unnecessary CT scans and avoids nontherapeutic laparotomies.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: As the rate of opioid use disorders continues to rise, perioperative physicians are increasingly faced with the challenge of providing analgesia to these patients after surgery. Due to the likelihood of opioid dose escalation in the perioperative period, we hypothesized that opioid-dependent patients would be at increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients undergoing 6 representative elective surgical procedures was performed using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2011. The primary outcome was a composite including prolonged mechanical ventilation, reintubation, and acute respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and total hospital costs. Both multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to determine the impact of opioid use disorder on outcomes. RESULTS: The total sample-weighted cohort consisted of 7,533,050 patients. Patients with opioid use disorders were more likely to suffer pulmonary complications, with a frequency of 4.2% compared to 1.6% in the nonopioid-dependent group (P < .001), and had a 1.62 times higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.27) in multivariable regression analysis. In a secondary subgroup analysis, only patients undergoing a colectomy had a greater odds of suffering pulmonary complications (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.42-4.91; P = .0021). Additionally, patients with an opioid use disorder had a longer length of stay (0.84 days [95% CI, 0.52-1.16; P < .001]) and greater costs ($1816 [95% CI, 935-2698; P < .001]). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with opioid use disorders are at increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications, and have prolonged length of stay and resource utilization. Further research is needed regarding interventions to reduce the risk of complications in this subset of patients.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: ABCD2 risk score and cerebral microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) have been separately shown to the predict risk of recurrent acute stroke. We studied whether ABCD2 risk score predicts cerebral microemboli in patients with hyper-acute symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We studied 206 patients presenting within 2\u2005weeks of transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke and found to have critical carotid artery stenosis (\u226550%). 86 patients (age 70\u00b11 (SEM: years), 58 men, 83 Caucasian) had evidence of microemboli; 72 (84%) of these underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). 120 patients (age 72\u00b11\u2005years, 91 men, 113 Caucasian) did not have microemboli detected; 102 (85%) of these underwent CEA. Data were analysed using X2 and Mann-Whitney U tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: 140/206 (68%: 95% CI 61.63 to 74.37) patients with hyper-acute symptomatic critical carotid stenosis had an ABCD2 risk score \u22654. There was no significant difference in the NICE red flag criterion for early assessment (ABCD2 risk score \u22654) for patients with cerebral microemboli versus those without microemboli (59/86 vs 81/120 patients: OR 1.05 ABCD2 risk score \u22654 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.90, p=0.867)). The ABCD2 risk score was <4 in 27 of 86 (31%: 95% CI 21 to 41) embolising patients and in 39 of 120 (31%: 95% CI 23 to 39) without cerebral microemboli. After adjusting for pre-neurological event antiplatelet treatment (APT), area under the curve (AUC) of ROC for ABCD2 risk score showed no prediction of cerebral microemboli (no pre-event APT, n=57: AUC 0.45 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.60, p=0.531); pre-event APT, n=147: AUC 0.51 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.60, p=0.804)). CONCLUSIONS: The ABCD2 score did not predict the presence of cerebral microemboli or carotid disease in over one-quarter of patients with symptomatic critical carotid artery stenosis. On the basis of NICE guidelines (refer early if ABCD2 \u22654), assessment of high stroke risk based on ABCD2 scoring may lead to inappropriate delay in urgent treatment in many patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: After a kidney transplantation, all efforts are focused on graft function. However, cardiovascular and neurologic complications might lead to decreased quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Early recognition of related symptoms might be critical to successfully manage these complications. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who had undergone kidney transplantation in a tertiary center between January 2014 and December 2017. Demographic data and past medical history were systematically gathered. Symptoms related to cardiac or neurologic disorders and final diagnoses were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six patients were evaluated by a cardiologist or a neurologist in the early post-operative period or long-term follow-up. Chest pain (n\u00a0= 17; 9.1%) and palpitations (n\u00a0= 13; 7.0%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 70.6% (n\u00a0= 12) of the patients presenting with chest pain. All of the patients were treated successfully, with either antianginal drugs or percutaneous angioplasty. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 53.9% (n\u00a0= 7) of the patients presenting with palpitations. Headache was the most prevalent chronic neurologic symptom (n\u00a0= 16; 8.6%). Transient ischemic attack occured in 7 patients (3.8%) and 5 (2.7%) patients experienced ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: Kidney transplantation is associated with short- and long-term cardiac and neurologic complications. Our findings underscore the crucial role of questioning symptoms that might be related to severe disorders. Asymptomatic patients with high risk factors must also be under scope. Attending physicians should have a low threshold for referring these patients to cardiologists and neurologists.",

        "a": "Background: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) commonly affects older individuals and is associated with a relatively high rate of recurrence after surgery. Many studies have created grading systems to identify patients at high risk of CSDH recurrence after the initial surgery. However, no system has been adopted widely. The authors present the first CSDH grading system created from a population-based single-center data set. Methods: A single-center Puerto Rican population-based retrospective analysis was performed on consecutive patients treated for a CSDH at a designated institution from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to create a CSDH recurrence grading scale. Retrospective validation was conducted on this sample population. Results: The study included 428 patients. Preoperative midline shift, postoperative midline shift, and size of postoperative subdural space differed between the recurrence and nonrecurrence groups (P = 0.03, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively). A multivariate analysis was used to create a 10-point grading scale comprising four independent variables. Recurrence rates progressively increased from the low-risk (0-3 points) to high-risk (8-10 points) groups (2.9% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: A 10-point grading scale for CSDH recurrence was developed with four components: preoperative midline shift (\u22641 and >1 cm), laterality (bilateral, unilateral-right, and unilateral-left), size of postoperative subdural space (\u22641.6 and >1.6 cm), and pneumocephalus (present or absent). Patients who scored higher on the scale had a higher risk of recurrence. This CSDH grading scale has implications for Puerto Rico and the general population as the elderly population increases worldwide.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate of metabolic testing after initiation of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) prescription in persons initially treated by conventional mood-stabilizers (lithium or anticonvulsants, as a proxy of bipolar disorder diagnosis) and to compare the rates of metabolic testing in these persons with those in persons with initiation of first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) prescription or with no antipsychotic prescription. METHOD: Data were anonymously extracted from the 2004 to 2006 French national health database of the R\u00e9gime Social des Travailleurs Ind\u00e9pendants (RSI). Patients aged 18 years and over were included in the cohort if they fulfilled the following criteria over a three-month inclusion period: refunding of lithium or anticonvulsant over the 3 months without discontinuation (as a proxy of bipolar disorder diagnosis), no concomitant refunding over the 3months of antipsychotic, and no concomitant refunding over the 3 months of an anti-diabetic drug (as a marker of diabetes) or a lipid-lowering drug (as a marker of hyperlipidemia). Metabolic testing was assessed using information collected in the RSI database on the reimbursement of glucose-specific serum tests (glycaemia) and lipid-specific serum tests (total cholesterol). Serum glucose and lipid testings were assessed at baseline and at 12-week follow-up for the first episode of antipsychotic dispensing. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare the rate of metabolic testing in users of SGA to those of users of FGA and to those of non-users of antipsychotics. RESULTS: Three thousand one hundred and seventy patients were included. Of the 490 (15.4%) persons with a first episode of antipsychotic dispensing after the index date, 138 (4.3%) were dispensed only FGA over the first episode and 352 (11.1%) SGA (including 37 patients with both SGA and FGA dispensing). Metabolic testing at baseline and at 12-week follow-up was performed for 14% of persons with initiation of FGA and 12% with initiation of SGA. Almost no patient had both baseline and follow-up testing. Testing rates were lower for lipid testing than for glucose testing. Compared to persons with no antipsychotic, persons with SGA were significantly more likely to have metabolic testing at baseline and at follow-up, independently from other characteristics (adjusted OR=0.24, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.36). No difference was found between persons with SGA and those with FGA (adjusted OR=1.12, 95%CI 0.62 to 2.0). Regarding the other characteristics associated with likelihood of metabolic testing (irrespective of the treatment group), women were more likely than men to have metabolic testing at baseline but not at follow-up. Elderly persons and persons with low occupational status were more likely to have metabolic testing at follow-up. CONCLUSION: From a public health point of view, such findings indicate that the metabolic risks associated with SGA use in real-life conditions are widely underestimated. Regarding the temporal trends of antipsychotic prescription, with the dramatic rise of SGA use observed in most countries, it is a public health priority to improve metabolic monitoring in SGA users, irrespective of the underlying diagnosis. Since it is more complex to modify pre-existing inadequate practices than to initiate correct ones in new prescribers, great attention should be paid to the need for delivering strong messages regarding the metabolic risks associated with SGA prescription during the initial training of physicians.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase (CML-BP) are historically dismal. Herein, the authors sought to analyze the characteristics, prognostic factors, and survival outcomes in patients with CML-BP in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. METHODS: A total of 477 patients with CML-BP were treated with a TKI at some point during the course of their CML. Cox proportional hazard models identified characteristics that were predictive of survival. Overall survival and failure-free survival were assessed. Optimal cutoff points for specific parameters were identified using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range, 16-84 years) and 64% were male. Approximately 80% of patients initially were diagnosed in the chronic phase of CML at a median of 41 months (range, 0.7-298 months) before transformation to CML-BP. De novo CML-BP occurred in 71 patients. Approximately 72% of patients received TKI therapy before CML-BP. The initial therapy for CML-BP included a TKI alone (35%), a TKI with chemotherapy (46%), and non-TKI therapies (19%). The median overall survival was 12 months and the median failure-free survival was 5 months. In multivariate analysis, myeloid immunophenotype, prior TKI, age \u226558 years, lactate dehydrogenase level \u22651227 IU/L, platelet count\u2009<\u2009102 K/\u03bcL, no history of stem cell transplantation, transition to BP from chronic phase/accelerated phase, and the presence of chromosome 15 aberrations predicted for a significantly increased risk of death. Achievement of major hematologic response and/or complete cytogenetic response to first-line treatment was found to be predictive of better survival. The combination of a TKI with intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation appeared to confer the best outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML-BP continue to pose a therapeutic challenge, have dismal outcomes, and require newer treatment approaches.

        "a": "AIM: Atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta is a leading cause of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, the ascending aorta is considered untouchable only in cases of severe calcification. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the no-touch aorta technique (NAT) on morbidity and mortality with an extension of indication to any degree of atherosclerotic disease is detected on the ascending aorta. METHODS: From March 2001 to March 2006, data were prospectively collected from 101 patients with ascending aorta atherosclerosis who underwent either on- or off-pump CABG with NAT. Demographic data from these 101 patients were compared with those of 1 473 patients who underwent conventional CABG with aortic cross-clamping during the same time period. All preoperative variables were assessed with stepwise logistic regression to determine predictors of ascending aortic disease. RESULTS: Age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, EuroSCORE and unstable and redo rates were significantly higher in the NAT group than in the control group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis of preoperative variables for all 1 574 cases identified age, peripheral vascular disease, history of smoking, EuroSCORE, and reoperation as independent predictors of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. No operative or hospital CVA occurred in the study group. Hospital mortality was observed in 2 (1.9%) patients. During the follow-up period of 27.9 +/- 13 months, no patient was re-admitted with angina recurrence or CVA. CONCLUSION: Any degree of atherosclerotic disease on the ascending aorta can potentially cause CVA upon manipulation during CABG. Use of CABG with NAT to eliminate the risk of CVA is associated with low rates of morbidity, stroke and mortality during hospital stay and at mid-term follow-up.",

        "a": "Epidemiological studies suggest increased fracture risk in patients using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We have previously shown that the H(+) /K(+) ATPase beta subunit knockout (KO) mouse, which is a model of PPI-use, have lower bone mineral density (BMD) and impaired bone quality compared to wild type (WT) mice. Like PPI users, these KO mice display elevated gastric pH and hypergastrinemia, which in turn stimulates gastric histamine release. Previous studies have suggested a negative effect of histamine on bone, thus, we wanted to study whether a histamine 1 receptor (H1R) antagonist could improve bone quality in KO mice. Female KO and WT mice aged 8 weeks received either an H1R antagonist (cetirizine) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 6 months. At the end of the study, KO mice displayed elevated plasma histamine levels compared to WT. As demonstrated previously, the KO mice also exhibited lower whole body BMD, reduced mechanical bone strength, and impaired bone quality assessed by \u03bcCT. No significant differences, however, were found between the KO groups receiving cetirizine or PEG for any of the measured bone parameters. In vitro gene expression analyses of histamine receptors revealed the presence of H1R and H2R both in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and H3R in late stage osteoblasts. In conclusion, administration of the H1R antagonist cetirizine in a concentration of 3\u2009mg/kg did not rescue the osteoporotic phenotype in H(+) /K(+) ATPase beta subunit KO mice. It can, however, not be ruled out that histamine may influence bone via other receptors. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 2089-2096, 2016. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

METHODS: Patients from our IRB-approved PCa database who underwent FC or SBRT and were eligible for both treatments were included. Patients with less than 1\u00a0year of follow-up or prior PCa treatment were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as salvage treatment or a Gleason group (GG) of\u2009\u2265\u20092 on post-treatment biopsy. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was evaluated with Phoenix. Functional outcomes were based on EPIC surveys. Complications were categorized with the CTCAE 5.0. Outcomes were compared using descriptive statistics, univariate analyses, and Kaplan-Meier curve for failure-free survival (FFS) and BCR-free survival. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was significant. RESULTS: 68 FC and 51 SBRT patients with a median age of 68\u00a0years (48-86) and a median follow-up time of 84 (70-101) months were included in this analysis. There was no difference in tumor risk (p\u2009=\u20090.47), GG (p\u2009=\u20090.20), or PSA (p\u2009=\u20090.70) among the two cohorts at baseline.

Adiponectin (ADP), a hormone produced by adipocytes, plays a central role in energy homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory response. ADP is negatively correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI) and is abnormal in patients with BD. Understanding the role of ADP among these offspring may help identify those likely to develop BD. The primary objective of this paper was to compare ADP levels among offspring of individuals with BD (symptomatic [SO], and asymptomatic [AO]) to offspring of healthy parents (HC). The role of ADP on cognition and ROI-based gray matter values in SO and AO offspring was secondarily assessed and compared to HC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in China by the Guangzhou Brain Hospital in offspring of individuals with and without BD. Participants underwent neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, MRI scans and blood analyses. BMI z-scores (zBMI) were calculated adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Analyses included 117 participants (HC\u00a0=\u00a048, AO\u00a0=\u00a036, SO\u00a0=\u00a033). No significant differences were observed in plasma levels of ADP optical density (OD) among HC, AO and SO participants.

Multivariate tests revealed a significant interaction between offspring symptomatic status, ADP OD, and zBMI on gray matter volume in the right cerebellum (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an interaction exists between BMI and CNS structure.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: The tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a set of complications that can arise from treatment of high burden, drug sensitive and rapidly proliferating neoplasm particularly of hematological origin. This syndrome can be observed before any treatment because of spontaneous tumoral cellular death, and is generally worsened when chemotherapy is initiated. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Although TLS is primarily observed during therapy of acute leukemia, Burkitt's lymphomas and lymphoblastic lymphomas, it can also be observed in other hematological malignancies and during the treatment of rare solid tumors. Important progress has recently been made in the management of TLS. The use of urate oxydase can rapidly control TLS induced hyperuricemia, which help to prevent the risk of calcium phosphate crystal precipitation. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: A global strategy for the management of SLT, combining adapted hydration, urate oxydase, and a close cooperation between intensive care units and hematology units can control this complication in most of the patients. The early management of TLS can, indeed, have an impact on the global therapy of these patients who need to be treated with high-dose anti-cancer agents with renal elimination.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Nurses practicing in long-term care or rehabilitation settings face unique challenges from prolonged or repeated exposure to stressors, given their extended time with patients. This puts them at risk for compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress, which can lead to decreased resilience and sleep problems. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine relationships among resilience, professional quality of life, sleep, and demographics in nurses working in long-term care or rehabilitation settings, and to investigate whether demographics, professional quality of life, and sleep quality are significant predictors of nurses' resilience. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used the following measures: demographics, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). Data were analyzed with SPSS v25. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regression. RESULTS: Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0120) were mostly female (85%) and registered nurses (90%). Mean scores were 52.13 for resilience and 7.53 for sleep quality. Mean ProQOL subscale scores were 41.78 for compassion satisfaction, 22.28 for compassion fatigue, and 23.92 for secondary traumatic stress. Multiple regression models showed that compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress significantly predicted resilience (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.69, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.61, and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.34, respectively, all p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Resilience is important in nurses' personal and professional lives because it helps to protect nurses from the negative consequences of stressors. Strategies, resources, and workplace support can promote self-care and resilience.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently increase cardiovascular risk in obesity. Although there is evidence that arterial stiffness is altered in OSA, knowledge of these effects with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in severe obesity (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 35\u00a0kg/m(2)) is limited. This study aimed to explore how arterial stiffness, as measured by the augmentation index (Aix), changed in severely obese patients with OSA who were treated with CPAP and in patients without OSA. METHODS: Forty-two patients with severe obesity-22 with OSA, 20 without OSA-were recruited at baseline and followed-up after a median of 13.5\u00a0months. Pulse wave analysis (PWA) was performed using applanation tonometry at the radial artery to measure augmentation index (Aix), augmentation pressure (AP) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR). Cardiovascular parameters and body composition were also measured. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in Aix, AP (both P\u2009<\u20090.001) and SEVR (P\u2009=\u20090.021) in OSA patients on CPAP compared with subjects without OSA. Epworth scores (P\u2009<\u20090.001), systolic (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and mean arterial pressures (P\u2009=\u20090.002) improved with CPAP. Regression showed that CPAP was significantly associated with change in arterial stiffness from baseline. However, patients with OSA on CPAP continued to have increased arterial stiffness (Aix) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), AP (P\u2009=\u20090.028) and reduced SEVR (P\u2009=\u20090.002) relative to non-OSA patients. CONCLUSION: Although sleepiness and blood pressure improve with CPAP in severe obesity, CPAP alone is not sufficient to modify PWA measures to levels comparable with non-OSA patients. This supports a need for a multifaceted approach when managing cardiovascular risk in patients with severe obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea receiving CPAP therapy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Cytokine release storm (CRS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is thought to be the cause for organ damage and death which is independent of the actual viral burden. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of CRS. We describe the efficacy and safety of TCZ in SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 20 2020 to May 21 2020. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of a composite of either need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Safety outcomes included an increase in liver transaminases and/or evidence of infection. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients received TCZ during the study period. The median age was 54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47-63). About 85% of the patients were male. Nearly 70% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. About 55% required ICU admission. The median duration of ICU stay was 11 days (95% CI: 3-13 days). The cumulative incidence of the requirement for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvement and mortality was 11% (95% CI: 0.03%-1%), 74% (95% CI 37%-89%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%-63%), respectively. There was no difference in outcomes according to age, gender or computed tomography severity score. Asymptomatic transaminitis was the most common drug reaction (55%), and one patient developed bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: TCZ is likely a safe and effective modality of treatment for improving clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS CoV-2 patients with a reduction in ICU stay and ventilatory care need.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the guidelines recommended by Cochrane. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across different anxiety and related disorders. SEARCH METHODS: This review fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov . Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB). MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias.There was no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the treatment of anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment responders, N = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; number of participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 91).There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality evidence for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. Although the observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a high efficacy of exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for clinical and methodological effect could not take place. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of effect in anxiety and related disorders.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Radiation oncologists rely on available clinical information (biopsy Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) to determine the optimal treatment regimen for each prostate cancer patient. Existing published nomograms correlating clinical to pathologic extent of disease were based on patients treated in the 1980s and 1990s at select academic institutions. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to examine pathologic outcomes (Gleason score and cancer stage) in early prostate cancer patients based on biopsy Gleason score and PSA concentration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis included 25,858 patients whose cancer was diagnosed between 2010 and 2011, with biopsy Gleason scores of 6 to 7 and clinical stage T1 to T2 disease, who underwent radical prostatectomy. In subgroups based on biopsy Gleason score and PSA level, we report the proportion of patients with pathologically advanced disease (positive surgical margin or pT3-T4 disease) or whose Gleason score was upgraded. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with pathologic outcomes. RESULTS: For patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 cancers, 84% of those with PSA <10 ng/mL had surgical T2 disease with negative margins; this decreased to 61% in patients with PSA of 20 to 29.9 ng/mL. Gleason score upgrading was seen in 43% (PSA: <10 ng/mL) to 61% (PSA: 20-29.9 ng/mL) of biopsy Gleason 6 patients. Patients with biopsy Gleason 7 cancers had a one-third (Gleason 3 + 4; PSA: <10 ng/mL) to two-thirds (Gleason 4 + 3; PSA: 20-29.9 ng/mL) probability of having pathologically advanced disease. Gleason score upgrading was seen in 11% to 19% of patients with biopsy Gleason 4 + 3 cancers. Multivariable analysis showed that higher PSA and older age were associated with Gleason score upgrading and pathologically advanced disease. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study to examine pathologic extent of disease and pathologic Gleason score upgrading based on clinically available information in modern patients. These data inform the selection of radiation therapy strategies and an understanding of whether prostatectomy alone is likely to be curative for patients with early prostate cancers.",

        "a": "Currently, adipose tissue is considered an endocrine organ, however, there are still many questions regarding the roles of adipokines-leptin and ghrelin being two adipokines. The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between the adipokines and their ratio with obesity and diabetes. Methods: Sixty patients (mean age 61.88 \u00b1 10.08) were evaluated. Cardiovascular risk factors, leptin, ghrelin, and insulin resistance score values were assessed. The patients were classified according to their body mass index (BMI) as normal weight, overweight, and obese. Results: 20% normal weight, 51.7% overweight, 28.3% obese, and 23.3% diabetic. Obese patients had higher leptin values (in obese 34,360 pg/mL vs. overweight 18,000 pg/mL vs. normal weight 14,350 pg/mL, p = 0.0049) and leptin/ghrelin ratio (1055 \u00b1 641 vs. 771.36 \u00b1 921 vs. 370.7 \u00b1 257, p = 0.0228). Stratifying the analyses according to the presence of obesity and patients' gender, differences were found for leptin (p = 0.0020 in women, p = 0.0055 in men) and leptin/ghrelin ratio (p = 0.048 in women, p = 0.004 in men). Mean leptin/BMI and leptin/ghrelin/BMI ratios were significantly higher, and the ghrelin/BMI ratio was significantly lower in obese and diabetic patients. In conclusion, obesity and diabetes are associated with changes not only in the total amount but also in the level of adipokines/kg/m2. Changes appear even in overweight subjects, offering a basis for early intervention in diabetic and obese patients.",

The purpose of this methodological study was to assess the methodological and reporting quality of recently published SRs and/or meta-analyses\u00a0(MAs) evaluating the effects of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) on clinical outcomes in stroke survivors. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, CENTRAL, REHABDATA, and PEDro were searched.

The quality of the evidence was also judged using the (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) GRADE\u00a0method. Results: In final, 14 SRs/MAs\u00a0met inclusion criteria. Evaluation of methodological quality using the AMSTAR-2 tool demonstrated that the overall quality of included reviews was mostly \"critically low\"\u00a0or \"low,\"\u00a0except for two studies that were \"high.\"\u00a0In addition, the findings showed that the mean score of the reporting quality of the included reviews based on the PRISMA criteria was 24.9, down from 42. In accordance with the overall evaluation applying the ROBIS tool, 14.3% of the review studies were evaluated as high RoB, 64.3% were evaluated as unclear RoB, and 21.4% were evaluated as low RoB. Regarding the level of evidence quality, the GRADE results indicated that the evidence quality of the included reviews was unsatisfactory. Conclusion: This study showed that although the reporting quality of recently published SR/MAs evaluating the clinical effects of AFOs in stroke survivors was moderate, the methodological quality of almost all reviews was suboptimal. Therefore, reviewers must consider a number of criteria in designing, conducting, and reporting their studies to move toward\u00a0transparent and conclusive results.",

METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital based on 2019 data. With a case-control design in a 1:2 ratio, the predictive ability of the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (Chinese Version) was determined by ROC curve. The best cut point was identified based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predict value and negative predict value. Conditional logistical regression analysis was conducted to test the predictive ability of each indicator. RESULTS: The study included 309 patients, with 103 in the case group and 206 in the control groups. Generally, the predictive ability was acceptable with the area under ROC curve value at 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.79). Positive predict value and negative predict value performed best at the cut point of 13. Sensitivity at cut point 6 was much higher than that at cut point 13, though specificity was lower.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The B-type natriuretic peptide for Acute Shortness of Breath EvaLuation (BASEL) study enrolled consecutive patients with acute dyspnoea. RESULTS: Cumulative mortality was 14.8%, 33.1% and 51.9% in 452 patients (age: 19-97 years; 58% male) within low (< 100 pg mL(-1)), intermediate (100-500 pg mL(-1)) and high (> 500 pg mL(-1)) BNP plasma levels at 18 months of follow-up. BNP classes (point estimate: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.19-2.03, P = 0.001) in addition to age, increased heart rate and diuretic use emerged as significant predictors for long-term mortality in multivariable Cox regression analyses.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of laparoscopic primary trocar small-intestine injury is unknown. The case presented here differed from a typical clinical course in that only excessive periumbilical fluid leak was present postoperatively. Neither classic symptoms nor signs were present to justify laparoscopic trocar small-bowel perforations. CASE: A 42-year-old woman (G2 P1011, height 5'4\", weight 132 lb) underwent elective, diagnostic, and operative laparoscopy with a lysis of extensive abdominal-pelvic adhesions for chronic pelvic pain. Preoperatively, the patient was classified as being at increased risk for intestinal laceration or perforation at the time of Veress needle or primary trocar insertion due to her surgical history. For this reason, mechanical bowel preparation with GoLYTELY was carried out. No intraoperative complications were noticed. After surgery, external, excessive fluid leak from the periumbilical incision only was observed (the three 5-mm incisions, in the lower part of the abdomen, were dry). Initially, this event was interpreted as residual irrigation fluid leakage. The patient was closely monitored for bowel injury, and neither medical condition nor laboratory tests changed from base within the initial 48 h, although excessive fluid drainage from periumbilical area was persistent. Enough time elapsed from laparoscopic surgery for CO2 and irrigation-fluid absorption; therefore, additional studies were ordered (an abdominal upright x-ray was inconclusive for viscous perforation and gastrointestinal x-ray with a water-soluble contrast medium documented small-intestine perforation). Exploratory laparotomy with partial bowel resection was executed. Postoperative clinical course was uneventful, and no long-term sequel was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Persistent excessive external fluid leak from the periumbilical area after laparoscopic surgery with no drainage from other incisional sides may suggest small-bowel injury. 2) latrogenic, internal-external canalization between the small intestine and the skin masked clinical symptoms and signs of small-intestinal injury. 3) Lack of classic symptoms, signs, or changes in pertinent laboratory data did not rule out small-bowel perforation.",

Diet has been implicated in the etiology of prostate cancer, including through its effects on inflammation. We examined the association between a newly developed dietary inflammatory index (DII) and prostate cancer in a case-control study of 40-80 yr old Jamaican males. A total of 229 incident cases and 250 controls attended the same urology out-patient clinics at 2 major hospitals and private practitioners in the Kingston, Jamaica metropolitan area between March 2005 and July 2007. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed using a previously validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was expanded to assess diet and cancer in this Jamaican population. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, with DII as continuous and expressed as quartiles. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, total energy intake, education, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and family history of prostate cancer. Men in the highest quartile of the DII were at higher risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-5.04; P(trend) = 0.08] compared to men in the lowest DII quartile. These data suggest a proinflammatory diet, as indicated by increasing DII score, may be a risk factor for prostate cancer in Jamaican men.",

        "a": "Introduction: Lung cancer is the predominant cause of death among cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type. Cigarette smoking is the prevailing risk factor for NSCLC, nevertheless, this cancer is also diagnosed in never-smokers. B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) belongs to immunological checkpoints which are key regulatory molecules of the immune response. A growing body of evidence highlights the important role of BTLA in cancer. In our previous studies, we showed a significant association between BTLA gene variants and susceptibility to chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and renal cell carcinoma in the Polish population. The present study aimed to analyze the impact of BTLA polymorphic variants on the susceptibility to NSCLC and NSCLC patients' overall survival (OS). Methods: Using TaqMan probes we genotyped seven BTLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs2705511, rs1982809, rs9288952, rs9288953, rs1844089, rs11921669 and rs2633582 with the use of ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. Results: We found that rs1982809 within BTLA is associated with NSCLC risk, where carriers of rs1982809G allele (AG+GG genotypes) were more frequent in patients compared to controls. In subgroup analyses, we also noticed that rs1982809G carriers are significantly overrepresented in never-smokers, but not in smokers compared to controls. Additionally, the global distribution of the haplotypes differed between the never-smokers and smokers, where haplotypes A G G C A, C G A C G, and C G A T G were more frequent in never-smoking patients. Furthermore, the presence rs1982809G (AG+GG genotypes) allele as well as the presence of rs9288953T allele (CT+TT genotypes) increased NSCLC risk in females' patients. After stratification by histological type, we noticed that rs1982809G and rs2705511C carriers were more frequent among adenocarcinoma patients. Moreover, rs1982809G and rs2705511C correlated with the more advanced stages of NSCLC (stage II and III), but not with stage IV. Furthermore, we showed that rs2705511 and rs1982809 significantly modified OS, while rs9288952 tend to be associated with patients' survival. Conclusion: Our results indicate that BTLA polymorphic variants may be considered low penetrating risk factors for NSCLC especially in never-smokers, and in females, and are associated with OS of NSCLC patients.",

        "a": "The definition of sepsis was updated to sepsis-3 in February 2016. However, the performance of the previous and new definition of sepsis remains unclear in China. This was a retrospective multicenter study in six intensive care unit (ICUs) from five university-affiliated hospitals to compare the performance between sepsis-1 and sepsis-3 in China. From May 1, 2016 to June 1, 2016, 496 patients were enrolled consecutively. Data were extracted from the electronic clinical records. We evaluated the performance of sepsis-1 and sepsis-3 by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) to predict 28-day mortality rates. Of 496 enrolled patients, 186 (37.5%) were diagnosed with sepsis according to sepsis-1, while 175 (35.3%) fulfilled the criteria of sepsis-3. The AUROC of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is significantly smaller than that of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) (0.55 [95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.64] vs. 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.77], P\u200a=\u200a0.008) to predict 28-day mortality rates of infected patients. Moreover, 5.9% infected patients (11 patients) were diagnosed as sepsis according to sepsis-1 but not to sepsis-3. The APACHE II, SOFA scores, and mortality rate of the 11 patients were significantly lower than of patients whose sepsis was defined by both the previous and new criteria (8.6\u00b13.5 vs. 16.3\u00b16.2, P\u200a=\u200a\u200a<\u200a0.001; 1 (0-1) vs. 6 (4-8), P\u200a=\u200a<0.001; 0.0 vs. 33.1%, P\u200a=\u200a0.019). In addition, the APACHE II, length of stay in ICU, and 28-day mortality rate of septic patients rose gradually corresponding with the raise in SOFA score (but not the SIRS score).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBM) are comprised of a heterogeneous population of tumor cells, immune cells, and extracellular matrix. Interactions among these different cell types and pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines may promote tumor development and progression. AIMS: The objective of this study was to develop a cytokine-related gene signature to improve outcome prediction for patients with primary GBM. METHODS: Here, we used Cox regression and risk-score analysis to develop a cytokine-related gene signature in primary GBMs from the whole transcriptome sequencing profile of the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database (n=105). We also examined differences in immune cell phenotype and immune factor expression between the high-risk and low-risk groups. RESULTS: Cytokine-related genes were ranked based on their ability to predict survival in the CGGA database. The six genes showing the strongest predictive value were CXCL10, IL17R, CCR2, IL17B, IL10RB, and CCL2. Patients with a high-risk score had poor overall survival and progression-free survival. Additionally, the high-risk group was characterized by increased mRNA expression of M2 microglia/macrophage markers and elevated levels of IL10 and TGF\u03b21. CONCLUSION: The six cytokine-related gene signature is sufficient to predict survival and to identify a subgroup of primary GBM exhibiting the M2 cell phenotype.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are caused by bacterial invasion of the skin and underlying soft tissues and can present with a wide spectrum of signs, symptoms and illness severity. They are a common indication for antimicrobial therapy. However, there are few data on treatment outcomes or the validity of clinical severity scores. METHODS: Two hundred and five adult patients admitted to Ninewells Hospital, Scotland in 2005, and treated with antibiotics for SSTI, were identified. They were stratified into four classes of severity (class IV = most severe) based on sepsis, co-morbidity and their standardized early warning score (SEWS). Empirical antimicrobial therapy by severity class was compared with the recommendations of a UK guideline. RESULTS: Thirty-five different empirical antimicrobial regimens were prescribed. Overall, 43% of patients were over-treated, this being particularly common in the lowest severity class I (65% patients). Thirty-day mortality was 9% (18/205) and 17 patients (8%) died during their index admission. Mortality (30 day) and inadequate therapy increased with severity class: I, no sepsis or co-morbidity (45% patients, 1% mortality, 14% therapy inadequate); II, significant co-morbidity but no sepsis (32% patients, 11% mortality, 39% therapy inadequate); III, sepsis but SEWS <4 (17% of patients, 17% mortality, 39% therapy inadequate); and IV, sepsis plus SEWS \u2265 4 (6% of patients, 33% mortality, 92% therapy inadequate). CONCLUSIONS: SSTI in hospital is associated with significant mortality. Choice of empirical therapy is not evidence based, with significant under-treatment of severely ill patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Comorbid psychiatric conditions present an added layer of challenge in managing patients, as each condition and associated set of symptoms exacerbate the complexity of the overall presentation. Premenopausal women may be at particular risk for inadequate care, as their comorbid conditions may present overlapping symptoms and mask independent premenstrual symptoms. The prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and associated conditions can be as high as 8% in women of reproductive age. Recognizing and assessing premenstrual symptoms that are comorbid with other psychiatric conditions can help contribute to a comprehensive treatment strategy and potentially improve the treatment response for the comorbid conditions. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) have been approved for premenstrual conditions and should be considered by the psychiatrist as an available treatment option. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old Caucasian female patient with comorbid major depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder, and histrionic personality disorder, with persistent suicidal ideation and distress intolerance, was treated with norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol with improvement in mood, anxiety, and menstrual cramping and with associated diminished suicidal ideation and improved distress tolerance. CONCLUSION: In this case, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores, as well as self- and peer-reported functionality, all suggested improvement in symptoms following the introduction of COCPs. The neurohormonal contribution to psychiatric conditions continues to be studied and is becoming increasingly important. An understanding of the presence and etiology of premenstrual symptoms should be part of a comprehensive psychiatric assessment of female patients, and consideration of COCPs in the treatment plan adds a potentially potent option for symptom mitigation and remission.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Alternative payment models have been viewed as successfully decreasing costs following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) while maintaining quality. Concerns exist regarding access to care for patients who may utilize more resources in a bundled payment arrangement. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients undergoing conversion of prior surgery to TKA have increased costs compared to primary TKA patients. METHODS: Claims from Medicare and a single private insurer were queried for all primary TKA patients at our institution from 2015 to 2016. Ninety-day post-acute care costs were compared between primary and conversion TKA. Secondary endpoints included discharge disposition, complications, and readmissions. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for increased post-acute care costs and short-term outcome metrics. RESULTS: Of 3999 primary TKA procedures, 948 patients (23%) underwent conversion TKA. Conversion TKA was associated with greater post-acute care costs in patients with commercial insurance ($4714 vs $3759, P\u00a0= .034). Among Medicare beneficiaries, prior ligament reconstruction was associated with increased post-acute care costs ($1917 increase, P\u00a0= .036), while prior fracture fixation approached statistical significance ($2402 increase, P\u00a0= .055). Conversion TKA was an independent risk factor for readmissions (odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.00-2.17, P\u00a0= .050), while patients with a prior open knee procedure had higher rates of complications (odds ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.004-5.778, P\u00a0= .049). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that conversion from prior knee surgery to TKA is associated with increased 90-day post-acute care costs and resource utilization, particularly prior open procedures. Without appropriate risk adjustment in alternative payment models, surgeons may be financially deterred from providing quality arthroplasty care given the reduced net payment and surgical complexity of such cases.",

In patients with CD4 counts <50 cells per cubic millimeter, there is a substantial clinical and survival benefit of early ART initiation. The purpose of this study was to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of starting ART at various time points during TB treatment in patients with CD4 counts \u226550 cells per cubic millimeter. METHODS: In the SAPiT trial, 642 HIV-TB coinfected patients were randomized to 3 arms: receiving ART within 4 weeks of starting TB treatment (early treatment arm; Arm-1), after the intensive phase of TB treatment (late treatment arm; Arm-2), or after completing TB treatment (sequential arm; Arm-3). Direct health care costs were measured from a provider perspective using a micro-costing approach. The incremental cost per death averted was calculated using the trial outcomes. RESULTS: For patients with CD4 count \u226550 cells per cubic millimeter, median monthly variable costs per patient were US $116, US $113, and US $102 in Arm-1, Arm-2 and Arm-3, respectively. There were 12 deaths in 177 patients in Arm-1, 8 deaths in 180 patients in the Arm-2, and 19 deaths in 172 patients in Arm-3. Although the costs were lower in Arm-3, it had a substantially higher mortality rate. The incremental cost per death averted associated with moving from Arm-3 to Arm-2 was US $4199. There was no difference in mortality between Arm-1 and Arm-2, but Arm-1 was slightly more expensive.

At present, the morbidity of IFD and the strategies to initiate antifungal treatment in HM patients with BSI remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient characteristics, infection-related variables, and therapy-related features of 1374 HM patients with proven BSI from three hospitals were reviewed to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors and prognosis of IFD. RESULTS: The morbidity of proven and probable IFD in HM patients with BSI was 11.2%, and the mortality of those patients was 40.5%. Existing IFD risk scores were not accurate enough in distinguishing these patients benefiting from antifungal prophylaxis. Multivariate logistic regression identified age >45 years, profound neutropenia, hypoproteinemia, and use of vasopressors as independent variables associated with IFD morbidity in HM patients with BSI. In patients with proven and probable IFD patients, age >45 years, Pitt bacteremia score >3, use of vasopressors, abnormal blood coagulation, and initiation of antifungal therapy within 72\u00a0hrs after the onset of fever were independent prognostic factors. The mortality was significantly reduced in patients with high-risk factors of IFD if they initiate antifungal treatment within 72\u00a0hrs after the onset of fever compared to the patients not. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality of IFD increase significantly in HM patients with BSI. Early antifungal therapy may improve prognosis in HM patients with BSI complicated with IFD risk factors.",

A diagnosis of probable RBD was associated with decreased velocity (-7.9 cm/s; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13.8 to -2.0; P\u2009<\u20090.01), cadence (-4.4 steps/min; 95% CI, -7.6 to -1.3; P\u2009<\u20090.01), significantly increased double limb support variability (30%; 95% CI, 6-60; P\u2009=\u20090.01), and greater stride time variability (29%; 95% CI, 2-63; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and swing time variability (46%; 95% CI, 15-84; P\u2009<\u20090.01). Probable RBD is associated with subtle gait changes prior to overt clinical parkinsonism. Diagnosis of probable RBD supplemented by gait analysis may help as a screening tool for disorders of \u03b1-synuclein.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy of the prostate in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy of the prostate was performed under local anesthesia in 24 patients (median age, 67 years) with BPH. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score, maximum flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, and prostate volume were measured preoperatively and 4 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Nine patients (37.5%) had urinary retention preoperatively. One patient (4.2%) required transurethral resection of the prostate due to retention despite improved symptoms, and 2 (8.3%) needed an alpha-blocker, postoperatively. The success rate was 87.5% after 4 months follow-up. All patients were catheter-free after the procedure. The mean IPSS score decreased from 26.08 +/- 3.9 to 13.33 +/- 4.69 (P < .001), and the mean maximum flow rate increased from 4.63 +/- 4.4 mL/s to 13.21 +/- 4.28 mL/s (P < .001). The mean prostate volume and mean residual urine volume were 46.38 +/- 16.8 mL and 160 +/- 57 mL, which decreased to 39.6 +/- 16 mL (P = .009) and 61.46 +/- 17.45 mL (P = .003), respectively. Fever, dysuria, and perineal pain (in 9 patients; 37.5%) were improved with conservative therapy. Retrograde ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence were not reported. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy of the prostate is a new, safe, and effective treatment for BPH. This technique is carried out under local anesthesia and mild sedation with little bleeding. It is especially appropriate for patients who present as high risk for general anesthesia.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the laparoscopic approach and pre- and postoperative conditions as predictors of 30-day mortality and morbidity in elective colectomy. METHODS: Elective colectomies were identified in the 2005-2008 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model 30-day mortality and morbidity following elective colectomy. Propensity scores were calculated to decrease selection bias. RESULTS: During the period studied, 14,321 patients underwent open colectomy and 10,409 underwent laparoscopic colectomy. Factors that significantly influenced mortality included male gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.4, confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.9]; age (OR 1.07, CI 1.05-1.08); comorbidities including dyspnea, ascites, congestive heart failure, dialysis, or disseminated cancer; and postoperative conditions including reintubation (OR 2.6, CI 1.6-4.0), renal failure (OR 3.8, CI 2.1-6.9), stroke (OR 6.44, CI 2.4-17.6), and septic shock (OR 13.1, CI 8.76-19.4). While laparoscopy was not independently associated with mortality, it was associated with decreased postoperative morbidity including reintubation (OR 0.74, CI 0.59-0.91), renal failure (OR 0.60, CI 0.4-0.91), septic shock (OR 0.74, CI 0.59-0.92), wound infection (OR 0.58, CI0.44-0.77), and pneumonia (OR 0.71, CI 0.59-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, laparoscopy was associated with a decrease in 30-day postoperative morbidity for colectomy. However, after adjusting for preoperative comorbidities and postoperative morbidities, laparoscopy did not independently influence mortality after colectomy.",

The authors investigated and evaluated the relationship between distinct peripheral lymphocyte subsets at admission and clinical outcome prior to hospital discharge so as to find a predictor to the prognosis of acute pancreatitis in lymphocyte profile. METHODS: Lymphocyte subsets in admission peripheral venous blood were tested through flow cytometry on 48 patients with acute pancreatitis. Clinical data was recorded as well. The primary observational outcomes were multiple organ failure (MOF) and infection. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in natural killer cells between two subgroups sorted by the presence or absence of infection (25.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.47 [95% CI 14.4, 36.6] vs 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.62 [95% CI 12.5,1 7.1] p\u2009=\u20090.021).

MOF patients were significantly older (55\u2009\u00b1\u200914.58 [95% CI 48.49,61.42] vs 46\u2009\u00b1\u200915.59 [95% CI 39.39,51.99] p\u2009=\u20090.04), and had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IIscores (7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.66 [95% CI 5.5,7.64] vs 4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.89 [95% CI 2.45,4.78] p\u2009=\u20090.001) and C reactive protein (100.53\u2009\u00b1\u200994.38 [95% CI 58.69,142.48] vs 50.8\u2009\u00b1\u200959.2 [95% CI 26.88,74.71] p\u2009=\u20090.04). In a multivariate regression model, only CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009CD127high cell was a significant predictor of non-MOF. For the detection of non-MOF, CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009CD127high cell generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve of 0.74. CONCLUSION: CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009CD127high cell at early phase of acute pancreatitis yields good specificity in detecting non-MOF at a suggested cutoff value 6.41%.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for recurrence by incorporating radiological and clinicopathological prognostic factors in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: All radiologic and clinicopathologic data of 489 patients with rectal cancer, retrospectively collected from a single institution between 2009 and 2013, were used to develop a predictive model for recurrence using the Cox regression. The model performance was validated on an independent cohort between 2015 and 2017 (N = 168). RESULTS: Out of 489 derivative patients, 103 showed recurrence after surgery. The prediction model was constructed with the following four significant predictors: distance from anal verge, MR-based extramural venous invasion, pathologic nodal stage, and perineural invasion (HR: 1.69, 2.09, 2.59, 2.29, respectively). Each factor was assigned a risk score corresponding to HR. The derivation and validation cohort were classified by sum of risk scores into 3 groups: low, intermediate, and high risk. Each of these groups showed significantly different recurrence rates (derivation cohort: 13.4%, 35.3%, 61.5 %; validation cohort: 6.2%, 23.7%, 64.7%). Our new model showed better performance in risk stratification, compared to recurrence rates of tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging in the validation cohort (stage I: 3.6%, II: 12%, III: 30.2%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the new prediction model was higher than TNM staging at 3-year recurrence in the validation cohort (0.853 vs. 0.731; p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The new risk prediction model was strongly correlated with a recurrence rate after rectal cancer surgery and excellent for selection of high-risk group, who needs more active surveillance. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Multivariate analysis revealed four significant risk factors to be MR-based extramural venous invasion, perineural invasion, nodal metastasis, and the short distance from anal verge among the radiologic and clinicopathologic data. \u2022 Our new recurrence prediction model including radiologic data as well as clinicopathologic data showed high predictive performance of disease recurrence. \u2022 This model can be used as a comprehensive approach to evaluate individual prognosis and helpful for the selection of highly recurrent group who needs more active surveillance.",

        "a": "Cardiac surgery lacks a method for quantifying postoperative morbidities. The Clavien-Dindo Complications Classification (CDCC) and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) were successfully implemented as outcome reporting methods in other surgical specialties. This study aims to validate these complication scales in cardiac surgery. Between 2010 and 2019, we prospectively collected data on 41,218 adult patients (73% men, mean age 67 \u00b1 11 years) undergoing cardiac surgery at 6 university hospitals. Complications were graded using the CDCC based on the complication's treatment invasiveness with adaptations for common treatments in cardiac surgery. CCI were calculated, representing multiple complications on a scale of 0 (no complication) to 100 (death). Associations with predictors of poor outcome were assessed using mixed-effects models accounting for center as a random effect. CDCC grade was 0 in 23.0%, I in 11.4%, II in 35.3%, IIIa in 6.4%, IIIb in 2.6%, IVa in 16.1%, IVb in 2.1%, and V in 3.1%. Median CCI was 23 (9, 40). A change from lowest to highest observed CDCC grade was associated with an increase in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality score from 1.1% to 4.7%, surgery duration from 177 to 233 minutes, and hospital stay from 5.2 to 17 days (all P < 0.0001). The CCI also increased with greater procedure complexity (P < 0.0001). Increase in CDCC/CCI is associated with greater comorbidities, surgery durations, lengths of stay, and procedure complexity, accurately reflecting the nuances of the adult cardiac surgery postoperative course. These have great potential for uniform outcome reporting and quality improvement initiatives.",

Objective: To quantify the associations of the timing and number of intervals of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics with the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the 1999 to 2008 population-based Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study, which are linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, Norwegian Patient Registry, and Norwegian Prescription Database. Two populations of participants were created: a full sample and a mental health sample. The full sample included mothers and their live-born singletons, whereas the mental health sample was restricted to offspring of mothers who reported anxiety, depression, or sleeping problems during pregnancy or 6 months before pregnancy. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to February 2022. Exposures: Maternal self-report of benzodiazepine and/or z-hypnotic use during pregnancy was grouped into early pregnancy exposure and middle and/or late pregnancy exposure for analysis of the association with timing of exposure, and number of 4-week intervals of exposure was classified (single [1] vs multiple [\u22652]) for analysis of the association with number of exposed intervals. Main Outcome and Measures: The outcome was ADHD, defined as time to ADHD diagnosis or filled prescription for ADHD medication. To control for confounding, inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated. The weights were derived from propensity score modeling of the probability of benzodiazepine and/or z-hypnotic exposure as a function of potential confounders between the exposure and the outcome, including maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The full sample comprised 82 201 pregnancies, and the mental health sample included 19 585 pregnancies. In total, 681 offspring (0.8%) in the full sample and 468 offspring (2.4%) in the mental health sample were prenatally exposed to benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics. After weighting, exposure in early (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.39-1.94) and middle and/or late (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.35-1.61) pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of childhood ADHD. There was no evidence of substantial association between the number of exposed intervals during pregnancy and childhood ADHD. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that there may be no increased risk of childhood ADHD associated with prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics, regardless of timing of exposure and number of exposed intervals. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to low study power.",

BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data regarding whether statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 reduce the metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite and diminish its clinical efficacy. METHODS: The CHARISMA trial was a randomized trial comparing long-term 75 mg/day clopidogrel versus placebo in patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors on aspirin. The primary end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death at median follow-up of 28 months. We performed a secondary analysis evaluating the interaction of clopidogrel versus placebo with statin administration, categorizing baseline statin use to those predominantly CYP3A4 metabolized (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin; CYP3A4-MET) or others (pravastatin, fluvastatin; non-CYP3A4-MET). RESULTS: Of 15,603 patients enrolled, 10,078 received a statin at baseline (8,245 CYP3A4-MET, 1,748 non-CYP3A4-MET) and 5,496 did not. For the overall population, the primary end point was 6.8% with clopidogrel and 7.3% with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; p = 0.22). This was similar among patients on CYP3A4-MET (5.9% clopidogrel, 6.6% placebo, HR 0.89; p = 0.18) or non-CYP3A4-MET statin (5.7% clopidogrel, 7.2% placebo, HR 0.78; p = 0.19).

        "a": "We describe the public health control measures implemented in Singapore to limit the spread of influenza A (H1N1-2009) and mitigate its social effects. We also discuss the key learning points from this experience. Singapore's public health control measures were broadly divided into 2 phases: containment and mitigation. Containment strategies included the triage of febrile patients at frontline healthcare settings, admission and isolation of confirmed cases, mandatory Quarantine Orders (QO) for close contacts, and temperature screening at border entry points. After sustained community transmission became established, containment shifted to mitigation. Hospitals only admitted H1N1-2009 cases based on clinical indications, not for isolation. Mild cases were managed in the community. Contact tracing and QOs tapered off, and border temperature screening ended. The 5 key lessons learnt were: (1) Be prepared, but retain flexibility in implementing control measures; (2) Surveillance, good scientific information and operational research can increase a system's ability to manage risk during a public health crisis; (3) Integrated systems-level responses are essential for a coherent public health response; (4) Effective handling of manpower surges requires creative strategies; and (5) Communication must be strategic, timely, concise and clear. Singapore's effective response to the H1N1-2009 pandemic, founded on experience in managing the 2003 SARS epidemic, was a whole-of-government approach towards pandemic preparedness planning. Documenting the measures taken and lessons learnt provides a learning opportunity for both doctors and policy makers, and can help fortify Singapore's ability to respond to future major disease outbreaks.",

Respiratory test results and Respicheck scores were analyzed. Respicheck total score and subscales correlated positively with global respiratory impairment. Respicheck appears to be able to discriminate between patients having a higher level of respiratory dysfunction from those having a lower risk of respiratory involvement. This might allow to better target efforts and resources in respiratory management in DM1.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury and troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial infarction. METHODS: 850 patients randomised to the point-of-care testing arm of the Randomised Assessment of Panel Assay of Cardiac markers (RATPAC) study in six emergency departments of low-risk patients presenting with chest pain were studied. Blood samples were obtained on admission and 90 min from admission. Myocardial infarction was defined by the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The following diagnostic strategies were compared by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and comparison of area under the curve: individual marker values and the combination of presentation heart fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) and copeptin with troponin. RESULTS: 68 patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Admission samples were available from 838/1132 patients enrolled in the study. Areas under the curve were as follows (CIs in parentheses): cardiac troponin I (cTnI) Stratus CS 0.94 (0.90 to 0.98), cTnI Beckmann 0.92 (0.88 to 0.96), cTnI Siemens ultra 0.90 (0.85 to 0.95), cardiac troponin T high sensitivity 0.92 (0.88 to 0.96), HFABP 1 0.84 (0.77 to 0.90) copeptin 0.62 (0.57 to 0.68). HFABP and copeptin were diagnostically inferior to troponin. The combination of HFABP (at the 95th percentile) and troponin (at the 99th percentile) increased diagnostic sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the best single marker. Addition of HFABP to high-sensitivity troponin increased diagnostic sensitivity. Additional measurement of copeptin is not useful in the chest pain population.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Augmentation index (AIx) and pulse pressure amplification (PPA, here the aortic/brachial pulse pressure ratio) are an age-related emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, it has not been clearly shown that AIx and PPA predict a high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between non-invasively measured aortic wave reflection (AWR) and PPA and CAD. METHODS: The study group consisted of 80 patients who were admitted to our institute for elective coronary angiography. We non-invasively measured augmentation pressure (AP), AIx, and PPA using radial applanation tonometry. RESULTS: When the extent of CAD was divided by no or minimal CAD, 1- or 2- and 3-vessel disease (VD), there was a significant association between the extent of CAD and AIx and PPA in patients aged <65 years, but not in patients aged \u2265 65 years. In multivariate regression analysis after controlling the traditional risk factors, the odds ratio of having 3VD was significant in patients aged <65 years: 2.15 (1.04-4.44; p=0.039) per 5% increase of AIx and 2.02 (1.15-3.55; p=0.015) per 0.05 increase of PPA, but not in patients aged \u2265 65 years. The severity of CAD expressed as a Gensini score showed a significant correlation with AP, AIx, and PPA in patients aged <65 years, but not in patients aged \u2265 65 years. CONCLUSION: Increasing of non-invasively measured AWR and PPA is related to the severity of CAD, particularly in younger patients up to 65 years of age.",

        "a": "Immunotherapy with anti-GD2 antibody (Ab) ch14.18/CHO is effective for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) patients and is mainly based on GD2-specific Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Strategies to further enhance the efficacy are important and currently explored in prospective clinical trials randomizing ch14.18/CHO \u00b1 IL-2. Recently, expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitory receptor by effector cells and its ligand (PD-L1) by tumor cells has been shown. Here, we report for the first time effects of PD-1 blockade on ch14.18/CHO-based immunotherapy and mechanisms involved. Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on NB and effector cells was analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry in the presence of ch14.18/CHO and/or IL-2. The effect of PD-1 blockade on ch14.18/CHO-mediated anti-NB immune response was evaluated using anti-PD-1 Ab both in vitro (Nivolumab) and in a syngeneic PD-L1+/GD2+ NB mouse model (anti-mouse PD-1). Culture of NB cells LA-N-1 (low PD-L1 baseline expression) with leukocytes and subtherapeutic ch14.18/CHO concentrations for 24\u00a0h induced strong upregulation of PD-L1, which was further increased by IL-2 resulting in complete inhibition of ch14.18/CHO-mediated ADCC. Importantly, blockade with Nivolumab reversed the PD-L1-dependent inhibition of ADCC. Similarly, co-incubation with anti-CD11b Ab abrogated the PD-L1 upregulation and restored ADCC. Mice treated with ch14.18/CHO in combination with PD-1 blockade showed a strong reduction of tumor growth, prolonged survival and the highest cytotoxicity against NB cells. In conclusion, ch14.18/CHO-mediated effects upregulate the inhibitory immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1, and combination of ch14.18/CHO with PD-1 blockade results in synergistic treatment effects in mice representing a new effective treatment strategy against GD2-positive cancers.",

        "a": "Background: We determined appropriate survival prediction machine learning models for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) using the \"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\" (SEER) database. Methods: In total, 4039 patients diagnosed with OPSCC between 2004 and 2016 were enrolled in this study. In particular, 13 variables were selected and analyzed: age, sex, tumor grade, tumor size, neck dissection, radiation therapy, cancer directed surgery, chemotherapy, T stage, N stage, M stage, clinical stage, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The T-, N-, and clinical staging were reconstructed based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual, 8th Edition. The patients were randomly assigned to a development or test dataset at a 7:3 ratio. The extremely randomized survival tree (EST), conditional survival forest (CSF), and DeepSurv models were used to predict the overall and disease-specific survival in patients with OPSCC. A 10-fold cross-validation on a development dataset was used to build the training and internal validation data for all models. We evaluated the predictive performance of each model using test datasets. Results: A higher c-index value and lower integrated Brier score (IBS), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) indicate a better performance from a machine learning model. The C-index was the highest for the DeepSurv model (0.77). The IBS was also the lowest in the DeepSurv model (0.08). However, the RMSE and RAE were the lowest for the CSF model. Conclusions: We demonstrated various machine-learning-based survival prediction models. The CSF model showed a better performance in predicting the survival of patients with OPSCC in terms of the RMSE and RAE. In this context, machine learning models based on personalized survival predictions can be used to stratify various complex risk factors. This could help in designing personalized treatments and predicting prognoses for patients.",

Moreover, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of nonfunctionally significant lesions does not improve clinical outcome and might be associated with potential procedural or stent related risks. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided PCI in the treatment of small coronary vessel lesions as compared with an angio-guided PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2004 to December 2008, all patients treated with PCI for stable or unstable angina in small native coronary vessels (reference vessel diameter and stent size <3 mm) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into angio-guided and an FFR-guided PCI groups. A total of 717 patients were enrolled (495 angio-guided, 222 FFR-guided). End points were death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), combined death or nonfatal MI, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and procedure costs. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as death, nonfatal MI, and TVR. Clinical follow-up was obtained in 97.5% (median follow-up: 3.3 [from 0.01-5] years) of the patients. Seventy-eight patients (35%) had a significant FFR (<0.80) and underwent PCI. Using a propensity score adjusted Cox analysis, patients treated with FFR-guided PCI had significantly lower combined death or nonfatal MI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.413; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.227-0.750; P=0.004), nonfatal MI (HR, 0.063; 95% CI, 0.009-0.462; P=0.007), TVR (HR, 0.517; 95% CI, 0.323-0.826; P=0.006), and MACE (HR, 0.458; 95% CI, 0.310-0.679; P<0.001). No difference was observed in mortality alone (HR, 0.684; 95% CI, 0.355-1.316; P=0.255). Procedure costs were also reduced in the FFR guided strategy (3253\u00b1102 Euros versus 4714\u00b137 Euros, P<0.0001).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Current risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDC) relies on left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, a poor marker of ventricular electrical instability. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance has the ability to accurately identify and quantify ventricular myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the presence and amount of myocardial fibrosis on arrhythmogenic risk prediction in NIDC. METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients with angiographically proven NIDC were enrolled for this study. All patients were followed up for a combined arrhythmic end point including sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) intervention, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and SCD. RESULTS: LV-LGE was identified in 76 (55.5%) patients. During a median follow-up of 3 years, the combined arrhythmic end point occurred in 22 (16.1%) patients: 8 (5.8%) sustained VT, 9 (6.6%) appropriate ICD intervention, either against VF (n = 5; 3.6%) or VT (n = 4; 2.9%), 3 (2.2%) aborted SCD, and 2 (1.5%) died suddenly. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant correlation between the LV-LGE presence (not the amount and distribution) and malignant arrhythmic events (P < .001). In univariate Cox regression analysis, LV-LGE (hazard ratio [HR] 4.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-11.2; P = .005) and left bundle branch block (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.01-5.41; P = .048) were found to be associated with arrhythmias. In multivariable analysis, the presence of LGE was the only independent predictor of arrhythmias (HR 3.8; 95% CI 1.3-10.4; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: LV-LGE is a powerful and independent predictor of malignant arrhythmic prognosis, while its amount and distribution do not provide additional prognostic value. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance may contribute to identify candidates for ICD therapy not fulfilling the current criteria based on left ventricular ejection fraction.",

Specific T2R38 polymorphisms, correlating with bitter taste sensitivity to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), have been identified as an independent risk factor for surgical intervention in CRS patients without polyps; however, the exact role of PTC tasting ability in clinical practice remains unknown. In this investigation we characterize PTC taste sensitivity in a tertiary care rhinology practice with pertinent clinical measures of disease and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Adult CRS patients were prospectively assessed for their ability to taste PTC and categorized as nontasters, tasters, or supertasters. Objective taste was assessed with strips for bitter, sweet, sour, and salty, whereas olfactory testing was measured with Sniffin' Sticks. Correlation was performed between PTC tasting ability and patient demographics, endoscopy scores, validated QOL surveys, and both subjective and objective measures of taste and olfaction. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled. Fifty-two percent were identified as nontasters, 34% as tasters, and 13% as supertasters. Nontasters were more likely to be non-Hispanic (p = 0.018), white (p = 0.027), without nasal polyposis (p = 0.004), and nonasthmatics (p = 0.019). There were no other statistical differences in patients' demographics, QOL measures, and subjective or objective olfactory and taste scores when compared with patients' oral PTC-sensing ability. CONCLUSION: Oral PTC-sensing ability may serve as a convenient marker of increased disease severity in white CRS patients without polyps and vary among regional populations. PTC tasting ability appears to provide unique phenotypic information not obtained using other subjective or objective measures of smell and taste.",

The purpose of the present paper was to carry out a retrospective study of the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in Princess Margaret Hospital. METHODS: From 1 to 31 March 2003, hospital records from 240 patients with confirmed SARS were studied. Patients with watery stool of >/=3 times/day for at least 3 consecutive days were defined as the diarrhea group. Clinical and demographic data were compared between the diarrhea and non-diarrhea groups. Chest X-ray (CXR) scores during the peak of diarrhea period were recorded by a respiratory physician. These CXR scores were correlated with the peak frequency of diarrhea by Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 20.4% of patients after admission.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study on 4 inpatient cohorts with CDI from 3 distinct sites: the universities of Michigan (2010-2012 and 2016), Chicago (2012), and Wisconsin (2012). The primary composite outcome was admission to an intensive care unit, colectomy, and/or death attributed to CDI within 30 days of positive testing. Both within each cohort and combined across all cohorts, published CDI severity scores were assessed and compared to each other and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline definitions of severe and fulminant CDI.

Performance of scores varied within each cohort and in the combined set (mean area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AuROC], 0.61; range, 0.53-0.66). Only half of the scores had performance at or better than IDSA severe and fulminant definitions (AuROCs of 0.64 and 0.63, respectively). Most of the scoring systems had more false than true positives in the combined set (mean, 81.5%; range, 0%-91.5%).

The primary outcome measure was 30-day readmission rates. Secondary outcome measures included 30-day rates of reoperation, length of stay, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and wound complications, including deep or superficial infection. Cirrhotic patients (n=665) and non-cirrhotic patients (n=13,363) were identified using the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index test. Cirrhotic patients were more likely to have preoperative ascites, renal failure, bleeding disorders, and preoperative transfusions. No differences were reported between the two groups in readmission rate or any of the secondary outcome measures, except that cirrhotic patients' length of stay was longer by 0.5 day. Stratification of the cirrhotic cohort demonstrated that a Model for End-stage Liver Disease sodium (MELD-Na) score of 8 or greater was associated with a 4.1-fold increase in the rate of readmission (5.9% vs 1.5%; P<.01). No other differences were identified based on MELD-Na score stratification. Patients with advanced cirrhosis (MELD-Na score \u22658) have an increased risk of 30-day readmission after tibia fracture surgery. Cirrhosis associated with a lower MELD-Na score might not significantly increase the risk of 30-day complications in patients with tibia fractures. [Orthopedics. 2022;45(2):79-85.].",

METHODS: One hundred neonates aged 0.5 h after birth, with the gestational age < 32 w, birth weight < 1500 g, and number of gastric, stable microbubble < or = 7/mm(2) by gastric stable microbubble test (SMT), but without clinical or radiological manifestations of RDS at the admission, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: prophylactic group (PG), receiving curosurf, a product of PS, immediately after admission; and non-prophylactic group (N-PG), receiving curosurf only after development of RDS. RESULTS: One hour after the administration of PS, the PaO(2), a/APO(2), pH, and PaO(2) of the PG group were 86.2 mm Hg +/- 8.1 mm Hg, 0.30 +/- 0.04, 7.38 +/- 0.06, and 178 +/- 37, all significantly higher than those of the non-PG group (all P < 0.01), and the PaCO(2) of the PG group was 37.3 mm Hg +/- 9.8 mm Hg, significantly lower than that of the non-PG group (53.6 mm Hg +/- 11.1 mm Hg, P < 0.01). In comparison with the level before the administration of PS (0.75 +/- 0.06), the level of FiO(2) of the 47 pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation decreased after the administration of curosurf time-dependently, e.g., was 0.50 +/- 0.09, 0.34 +/- 0.06, and 0.25 +/- 0.07 8, 48, and 96 hours after the administration. In comparison with the level before the administration of curosurf 9.0 +/- 1.0 cm H2O, the level of mean airway pressure (MAP) decreased time-dependently after the administration, e.g., were 7.5 +/- 0.8 and 6.0 +/- 0.3 48 and 96 hours after the administration (all P < 0.01). Compared with that before the administration of curosurf (3.02 +/- 0.2), the X-ray chest score decreased time-dependently after the administration of curosurf, e.g., were 1.89 +/- 0.34, 1.82 +/- 0.33, and 1.17 +/- 0.42 6, 12, and 72 hours after the administration (all P < 0.01). The RDS rate of the PG group was 30%, significantly lower than that of the non-PG group (P < 0.01). The severe case rate of the PG group was 20%, significantly lower than that of the N-PG group (53%, P = 0.01). The mortally of the PG group was 0, significantly lower than that of the non-PG group (P < 0.05). The total times of supplemental oxygen administration, assisted ventilation and hospitalization of the 47 patients with RDS in the PG group were significantly shortened compared with the RDS patients in the N-PG group [(3.6 +/- 1.7) d vs. (5.9 +/- 3.6) d, P < 0.05; (8.6 +/- 5.5 d vs. (14.1 +/- 6.2) d, P < 0.01; and (20.5 +/- 10.0) d vs. (32.8 +/- 17.8) d, P < 0.05).

The effectiveness of neoadjuvant intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has never been reported. This prospective, non-randomized phase II study included patients with PMP treated between May 2017 and December 2018, who were not considered suitable for primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The majority of patients were treated with laparoscopic HIPEC (oxaliplatin 200 mg/m2, 60 min, 43 \u00b0C). IP chemotherapy was started 2 weeks after docetaxel 40 mg/m2 + cisplatin 40 mg/m2, accompanied by oral S1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) (50 mg/m2) for 14 days, followed by one week rest. Clinical parameters and complications were recorded. In total, 22/27 patients qualified for CRS and HIPEC after neoadjuvant treatment. A complete cytoreduction (Completeness of cytoreduction Score 0/1) could be achieved in 54.5%. The postoperative morbidity rate was 13.6% and mortality was rate 4.5%. In total, 20/22 patients had major pathological tumor responses. The mean drop in CEA was 28.2% and in the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 2.6. Positive or suspicious cytology turned negative in 69.2% of patients. Thus, for PMP patients who were not amenable for primary surgery, the majority received complete cytoreduction after treatment with neoadjuvant IP chemotherapy, with satisfying tumor regression and with low complication rates. The oncological benefit in terms of survival with this new treatment regimen needs to be proven.",

This study determined the one-year survival rate and prognostic factors of hospitalized hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke patients from 1991 to 2008 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. We also evaluated the improvements in the one-year mortality after stroke during an 18-year study period. Patients admitted for cerebral hemorrhage (n = 3,678) and cerebral infarction (n = 16,010), identified from an in-patient electronic database, were linked to the National Death Registry of Taiwan. Actuarial analysis was used to determine the one-year survival rates, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to investigate the predictors for the one-year mortality of stroke patients. For patients with cerebral hemorrhage and infarction and who were admitted from 1991 to 2008, the one-year survival rates were 71% and 84%, respectively. In addition, stroke patients who also suffered from myocardial infarction, chronic renal illness, and pneumonia and had high Charlson comorbidity index scores showed increased risks of mortality due to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction. Compared with the patients admitted from 1991 to 1996, those admitted from 1997 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2008 showed 15%-20% and 20%-25% reduction in one-year mortality risk in cerebral hemorrhage and infarction, respectively. This result demonstrates the continuous quality improvement of stroke management in the hospital from 1991 to 2008. Further reduction in one-year mortality can be achieved by early recognition and prompt treatment of certain comorbidities.",

We retrospectively reviewed studies evaluating the benefit of pulmonary metastasectomy in RCC patients and evaluating the place of different chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies through November 1, 2019. Several retrospective studies have shown the benefit of pulmonary metastasectomy in metastatic RCC (mRCC), most in a situation with only pulmonary metastases. According to the prognostic criteria of the IMDC risk model, the patient is classified into a prognostic group to identify the best systemic treatment. With the development of targeted therapies, the modalities are multiple and may involve tyrosine kinase inhibitors/checkpoint inhibitors and soon vaccine therapy or CAR-T cells. At the local level, in patients who cannot benefit from surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy or radiofrequency has a place to be considered. Although there is a lack of a randomized study, pulmonary metastasectomy appears to be feasible and effective.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Elderly patients admitted with hip fractures often receive allogenic blood transfusion (ABT) in the perioperative period. We examined the effect of the shelf life of the ABT on mortality and morbidity. METHODS: A total of 1381 patients with hip fractures were retrospectively analysed. Two groups were compared, group A ('new'), with an ABT shelf life\u226414 days, and group B ('old'), with an ABT shelf life>14 days. Data collected for both groups included general demographic data, data regarding postoperative infections and other complications rates and data regarding mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess difference in survival between the groups. Cox regression was performed to analyse the survival after controlling for age, sex, pre-surgical haemoglobin concentration, pre-surgical creatinine, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, surgery type and number of blood units given. RESULTS: Higher mortality was seen in hip fracture patients who received 'old' blood unit compared to 'new' blood unit but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.5). Cox regression model demonstrated that designation into either young or old groups was not associated with mortality (hazard ratio: 1.14 (confidence interval: 0.85-1.53)). No differences were noted between the groups with regard to infection and other postoperative complication rates. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures who received 'old' units of blood did not differ from those receiving 'new' units with regard to mortality and morbidity.

To find adequate methods for its foresight is a challenge. OBJECTIVES: To determine risk factors and an angiographic score to predict the appearance of restenosis after one-site percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). METHODS: We restudied prospectively 315 (239 men, 76 women, age range from 29 to 78, 53.6 +/- 9.5 years) of 360 patients who underwent PTCA to a native coronary artery. The study didn\u00d5t include patients with left main disease, total occlusion, side-branch involvement, ostial stenosis, acute phase of myocardial infarction or those who repeat PTCA. Two-hundred twenty-eight patients underwent PTCA of the left anterior descending artery, 56 of the right coronary artery and 31 of the left circumflex artery. RESULTS: Restenosis, defined as a luminal renarrowing > 50% at follow-up, was present in 82 (26%) patients between 1 and 8 months after the procedure. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed four vascular factors related to restenosis (p < 0.05): a) lesion length and; b) irregularity of the lesion borders before PTCA; c) perivascular and/or endovascular haziness and; d) intensity of residual stenosis after PTCA. To construct the score, a zero was given to a lesion length < 8 mm; to smooth lesion borders; to residual stenosis up to 20%; and to absence of haziness after PTCA. A one was given to a lesion length between 8 and 10 mm; and to a lesion with irregular borders. A two was given to a lesion length > 10 mm. A three was given to a residual stenosis > 20%; and to the presence of haziness after PTCA. The sum of all terms was considered the final score. So, it could oscillate from 0 to 9. Calculated score from 0 to > 5 showed respective restenosis rates of (%): 5.2; 15.1; 24.0; 39.4; 44.8; 60.8; and 84.2. The calculated correlation coefficient (0.98) among the scored values and the correspondent restenosis rates was highly significant (p < 0.001).

METHODS: The study evaluated all patients with colorectal cancer referred to either general surgical units or a colorectal unit from 1/1996 to 6/2001. These results were compared to a historical control group treated within general surgical units at the same hospital from 1/1989 to 12/1994. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared the overall survivals (all-cause mortality) between the groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the influence of a number of independent variables on survival. These variables included age, ASA score, disease stage, emergency surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, disease location, and surgical unit. RESULTS: There were 974 patients involved in this study. There were no significant differences in the demographic details for the three groups. Patients in the colorectal group were more likely to have rectal cancer and Stage I cancers, and less likely to have Stage II cancers. Patients treated in the colorectal group had a significantly higher overall 5-year survival when compared with the general surgical group and the historical control group (56 % versus 45 % and 40 % respectively, P<0.01). Survival regression analysis identified age, ASA score, disease stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and treatment in a colorectal unit (Hazards ratio: 0.67; 95 % CI: 0.53 to 0.84, P =0.0005), as significant independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there may be a survival advantage for patients with colon and rectal cancers being treated within a specialist colorectal surgical unit.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Several dietary factors have been considered to be involved in the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in industrialised countries. Experimental and epidemiological evidence has been suggestive but not conclusive for a protective role for high dietary calcium intake. Intervention studies with colorectal cancer as an endpoint are difficult to perform owing to the large number of patients and the long follow-up required; studies using the appearance of colorectal adenomatous polyps as a surrogate endpoint are therefore considered in reviewing the existing evidence. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to assess the effect of supplementary dietary calcium on the incidence of colorectal cancer and the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register, MEDLINE, Cancerlit , and Embase, to July 2007. The reference lists of identified studies were inspected for further studies, and the review literature was scrutinized. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of the effects of dietary calcium on the development of colonic cancer and adenomatous polyps in humans are reviewed. Studies of healthy adults and studies of adults at higher risk of colon cancer due to family history, previous adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease were considered; data from subjects with familial polyposis coli are excluded. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of colon cancer, and occurrence or recurrence of any new adenomas of the colon. Secondary outcomes were any adverse event that required discontinuation of calcium supplementation, and drop-outs before the end of the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. The outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data were combined with the fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies with 1346 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Both trials were well designed, double - blind, placebo controlled trials, included participants with previous adenomas. The doses of supplementary elemental calcium used were 1200 mg daily for a mean duration of 4 years, and 2000 mg/day for three years. The rates of loss to follow -up were 14 % and 11%. For the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma, a reduction was found (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95) when the results from both trials were combined. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the evidence from two RCTs suggests that calcium supplementation might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer.",

According to recent guidelines, zero-balance fluid therapy is recommended in low-risk patients, and immediate correction of low urine output during surgery is discouraged. However, several reports have indicated an association of intraoperative oliguria with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). We investigated the impact of intraoperative oliguria in the colorectal ERAS setting on the incidence of postoperative AKI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2017 to August 2019, a total of 453 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection with the ERAS protocol. Among them, 125 patients met the criteria for oliguria and were propensity score (PS) matched to 328 patients without intraoperative oliguria. After PS matching had been performed, 125 patients from each group were selected and the incidences of AKI were compared between the two groups. Postoperative kidney function and surgical outcomes were also evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in the intraoperative oliguria group than in the non-intraoperative oliguria group (26.4% vs. 11.2%, respectively, P = 0.002). Also, the eGFR reduction on postoperative day 0 was significantly greater in the intraoperative oliguria than non-intraoperative oliguria group (-9.02 vs. -1.24 mL/min/1.73 m2 respectively, P < 0.001). In addition, the surgical complication rate was higher in the intraoperative oliguria group than in the non-intraoperative oliguria group (18.4% vs. 9.6%, respectively, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the proven benefits of perioperative care with the ERAS protocol, caution is required in patients with intraoperative oliguria to prevent postoperative AKI. Further studies regarding appropriate management of intraoperative oliguria in association with long-term prognosis are needed in the colorectal ERAS setting.",

This study aimed to examine the mortality and functional outcomes of patients with CLTI who predominantly had diabetes mellitus in a multi-ethnic Asian population in Singapore. METHODS: Patients with CLTI who underwent PTA between January 2015 and March 2017 at the Vascular Unit at Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, were studied. Primary outcome measures were 30-day unplanned readmission, two-year major lower extremity amputation (LEA), mortality rates, and ambulation status at one, six and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 221 procedures were performed on 207 patients, of whom 184 (88.9%) were diabetics. The one-, six- and 12-month mortality rate was 7.7%, 16.4% and 21.7%, respectively. The two-year LEA rate was 30.0%. At six and 12 months, only 96 (46.4%) and 93 (44.9%) patients were ambulant, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative ambulatory status, haemoglobin, Wound Ischaemia and foot Infection (WIfI) score, and end-stage renal failure (ESRF) were independent predictors of one-year ambulatory status. Predictors of mortality at one, six and 12 months were ESRF, preoperative albumin level, impaired functional status and employment status. CONCLUSION: PTA for CLTI was associated with low one-year mortality and two-year LEA rates but did not significantly improve ambulation status. ESRF and hypoalbuminaemia were independent predictors of mortality. ESRF/CKD and WIfI score were independent predictors of loss of ambulation at six months and one year. We need better risk stratification for patients with CLTI to decide between initial revascularisation and an immediate LEA policy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Prior to implementing predictive models in novel settings, analyses of calibration and clinical usefulness remain as important as discrimination, but they are not frequently discussed. Calibration is a model's reflection of actual outcome prevalence in its predictions. Clinical usefulness refers to the utilities, costs, and harms of using a predictive model in practice. A decision analytic approach to calibrating and selecting an optimal intervention threshold may help maximize the impact of readmission risk and other preventive interventions. OBJECTIVES: To select a pragmatic means of calibrating predictive models that requires a minimum amount of validation data and that performs well in practice. To evaluate the impact of miscalibration on utility and cost via clinical usefulness analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective cohort study with electronic health record data from 120,000 inpatient admissions at an urban, academic center in Manhattan. The primary outcome was thirty-day readmission for three causes: all-cause, congestive heart failure, and chronic coronary atherosclerotic disease. Predictive modeling was performed via L1-regularized logistic regression. Calibration methods were compared including Platt Scaling, Logistic Calibration, and Prevalence Adjustment. Performance of predictive modeling and calibration was assessed via discrimination (c-statistic), calibration (Spiegelhalter Z-statistic, Root Mean Square Error [RMSE] of binned predictions, Sanders and Murphy Resolutions of the Brier Score, Calibration Slope and Intercept), and clinical usefulness (utility terms represented as costs). The amount of validation data necessary to apply each calibration algorithm was also assessed. RESULTS: C-statistics by diagnosis ranged from 0.7 for all-cause readmission to 0.86 (0.78-0.93) for congestive heart failure. Logistic Calibration and Platt Scaling performed best and this difference required analyzing multiple metrics of calibration simultaneously, in particular Calibration Slopes and Intercepts. Clinical usefulness analyses provided optimal risk thresholds, which varied by reason for readmission, outcome prevalence, and calibration algorithm. Utility analyses also suggested maximum tolerable intervention costs, e.g., $1720 for all-cause readmissions based on a published cost of readmission of $11,862. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of calibration method depends on availability of validation data and on performance. Improperly calibrated models may contribute to higher costs of intervention as measured via clinical usefulness. Decision-makers must understand underlying utilities or costs inherent in the use-case at hand to assess usefulness and will obtain the optimal risk threshold to trigger intervention with intervention cost limits as a result.",

OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to summarize the evidence regarding patient portal use (portals that are connected to electronic health care records) or patient portal functionality use (eg, appointment booking and e-messaging) and their reported associations with health and health care quality outcomes among adult patients with diabetes. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases and reported the review methodology using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and two reviewers assessed the full texts of relevant studies and performed data extraction and quality assessments of the included studies. We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were summarized through narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in this review. Five studies reported overall patient portal use and its association with diabetes health and health care quality outcomes. Six studies reported e-messaging or email use-associated outcomes, and two studies reported prescription refill-associated outcomes. The reported health outcomes included the associations of patient portal use with blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and BMI. Few studies reported health care utilization outcomes such as office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. A limited number of studies reported overall quality of care for patients with diabetes who used patient portals. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies mostly reported improved glycemic control outcomes for patients with diabetes who used patient portals. However, limitations of studying the effects of patient portals exist, which do not guarantee whether the outcomes reported are completely the result of patient portal use or if confounding factors exist. Randomized controlled trials and mixed-methods studies could help understand the mechanisms involved in health outcome improvements and patient portal use among patients with diabetes.

The imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) are associated with frailty, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mediating role of sleep quality in the relationship between CSVD burden and frailty. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study and enrolled community residents. Frailty and sleep quality were measured using the Fried frailty phenotype and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. A multivariate linear regression analysis and a Bootstrap analysis were performed to examine the association among the key variables and the mediating role of sleep quality. Results: Of the 726 participants (mean age: 65.5 \u00b1 6.5 years, 59.8% female), the numbers (percentages) of the frail, prefrail, and robust residents were 49 (6.7%), 310 (42.7%), and 367 (50.6%), respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the CSVD burden and PSQI score were significantly associated with the frailty score. In addition, sleep quality played a partial mediating role in the association between CSVD burden and physical frailty. The mediating effect was 21.9%. Conclusion: The present study suggests that sleep quality is a mediator of this association between CSVD and frailty in community-dwelling older adults. Improving sleep quality might be helpful to mitigate the risk of frailty in CSVD patients.",

        "a": "Opportunities to evaluate, treat, and prevent future osteoporotic fractures are often being overlooked, especially in patients with a prior osteoporotic fracture. We find that an intensive outreach osteoporosis investigation strategy can help increase the number of patients investigated and treated for osteoporosis following a hip fracture. PURPOSE: Patients experiencing a hip fracture are subject to an increased risk of subsequent fractures. This suggests an urgent need to develop strategies that will allow a higher number of patients with fragility hip fractures to be investigated and treated for osteoporosis. In accordance, we developed a secondary osteoporosis prevention program and evaluated the results of the program. METHODS: In the study period, 1071 patients with a hip fracture were admitted to Hvidovre University Hospital. Eligible patients were offered an osteoporosis investigation program, which included a DXA-scan with vertebral fracture assessment and a medical consultation. The data retrieved from this program were registered and analyzed. The primary goal of the study was to describe the number of subjects, who completed the program, and to characterize the initiated osteoporosis treatment. Secondary outcomes evaluated were prevalence of DXA-verified osteoporosis, changes in T-score due to treatment, and 1-year mortality rate. RESULTS: In total, 557 patients were offered participation of which 333 patients completed the full program. Among these, 159 patients had DXA-verified osteoporosis and 192 patients were started treatment. This resulted in a significant higher T-score at the lumbar spine and femoral neck compared with subjects not treated. Additionally, we report a 1-year mortality rate of 27.7% among all patients with hip fracture. CONCLUSION: We report that an intensive outreach osteoporosis investigation program can help increase the number of hip fracture patients being tested and treated for osteoporosis. Further, the initiation of treatment can significantly increase the T-score.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration increased ovarian preantral follicles and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) in animal models with diminished ovarian reserve. We investigated whether G-CSF priming before treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) improved embryo development and pregnancy rate while increasing serum AMH in patients with poor ovarian reserve. METHODS: In this prospective randomized open-label controlled trial, 100 patients 20 to 42\u00a0years old with AMH below 2\u00a0ng/mL were randomized to priming or control groups (50 patients each). None had over 1 ART failure, day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) above 30\u00a0IU/L, uterine anomalies, or a partner with azoospermia. All patients initially underwent conventional infertility treatment for 2 consecutive cycles in which the priming group but not controls received a subcutaneous G-CSF priming injection during the early luteal phase. Each group then underwent 1 cycle of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection and fresh embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI-fresh ET), followed by cryopreserved ET if needed until live birth or embryo depletion. AMH was measured before and after priming. RESULTS: Fertilization rate, embryonic development, and implantation rate by fresh ET were significantly improved by priming. Clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates by IVF/ICSI-fresh ET were significantly higher with priming (30% and 26% in 47 ART patients; 3 delivered with conventional treatment) than in controls (12% and 10% in 49 ART patients; 1 dropped out). With priming, significantly more patients achieved cryopreservation of redundant blastocysts. The cumulative live birth rate was 32% in 50 patients with priming, significantly higher than 14% in 49 controls (relative risk, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-7.7). Infants derived from priming had no congenital anomalies, while infant weights, birth weeks, and Apgar scores were similar between groups. Among 4 variables (age, day-3 FSH, AMH, and priming), logistic regression significantly associated age and priming with cumulative live birth. Priming significantly increased serum AMH. No adverse effects of priming were observed. CONCLUSION: G-CSF priming improved embryonic development and pregnancy rate during ART treatment and increased AMH in patients with poor ovarian reserve. Enhanced preantral follicle growth likely was responsible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN registration in Japan (UMIN000013956) on May 14, 2014.\u00a0 https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm .",

        "a": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We evaluated the impact of remission of nephrotic-range albuminuria (>2500 mg/24 h) (NRA) on end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. METHODS: This was a follow-up observational study involving all 79 patients (35%; 62 men, 17 women) with NRA from a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy that was followed for at least 3 years at the Steno Diabetes Center (n=227). Patients were followed from the onset of NRA until death or January 2005. The mean age (+/-SD) was 60+/-8 years and known diabetes duration was 14+/-7 years. Remission of NRA was defined as sustained albuminuria <600 mg/24 h for at least 1 year. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up after onset of NRA was 6.5 years (range 2-20 years). Remission was induced in 20 (25%) of the patients, all treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Remission lasted 4.1 years (range 1-10 years) and only three patients relapsed. At the end of follow-up, only 30% (two ESRD and four deaths) of the 20 patients with remission had reached the composite endpoint of ESRD or death, in contrast to 66% (16 ESRD and 23 deaths) of the 59 patients without remission (p<0.01). Cox regression analysis revealed that remission was associated with a risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 10-87) for reaching the composite endpoint of ESRD or death and of 69% (95% CI 21-88%) for death alone. Male sex, greater age and systolic blood pressure at onset of NRA were also independently associated with an increased risk of ESRD and death. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Aggressive antihypertensive treatment can lead to long-term remission of NRA in a sizeable proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes. Such remission is associated with a slower progression of nephropathy and substantially improved survival.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of upper pole access during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), an option pole often avoided due to the concern for pleural injury. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on patients undergoing PCNL at our institution. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to access: supracostal upper calyx (group 1), subcostal upper calyx (group 2), and nonupper calyx (group 3). Preoperative imaging was reviewed to assess stone burden, Hounsfield units (HU), location, and Guy's Stone Score. Patients were considered stone-free if residual fragments were 3 mm or smaller on CT scan. RESULTS: We analyzed 329 PCNLs (left: 174; right: 155). Stones had a median size of 32 mm, 800 HU, and Guy's Stone Score of 2. Groups 1, 2, and 3 had 119, 108, and 102 patients, respectively. The 90-day complication rate was 20.4% (7.9% Clavien 3-4). Group 1 patients, with higher BMI and larger stones, had higher SFR than group 3 (89.9% vs 79.4%, P\u202f=\u202f.038), but with a significantly higher risk of complications (P\u202f=\u202f.001). Within group 1, left PCNL (7.0% vs 24.2%, P\u202f=\u202f.016) and BMI \u226530 (6.9% vs 25.0%, P\u202f=\u202f.013) carried a lower risk of chest tube insertion. There was no difference in complications between groups 2 and 3 (1.9% vs 2.9%). CONCLUSION: Upper pole access is safe and effective, particularly if done below the ribs.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: We examined the combined effect of erythropoietin (EPO) hyporesponsiveness and low handgrip strength (HGS) on the prognosis of patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: We recruited patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 5, who were undergoing HD at our dialysis clinic between January 2015 and March 2015 (n\u2009=\u2009182). Patients of \u226520\u2009years of age and who had been undergoing HD for \u22673\u2009months at enrollment were eligible for inclusion. Seven patients treated with epoetin-\u03b2 pegol were excluded. First, the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) and HGS were measured. The patients were stratified by the ERI of 9.44 (U/kg/week/g/dL), and by the HGS of 28\u2009kg for men and 18\u2009kg for women. We then observed death and cardiovascular disease (CVD), composite endpoint (deaths or CVD) for a median of 2\u2009years. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients (male, n\u2009=\u2009122; female, n\u2009=\u200953; age, 34-92\u2009years) were included in the analysis. During the observation period of 24\u2009months, 57 events (14 deaths and 43 CVD) were observed. High ERI and low HGS were associated with a high incidence of endpoints compared to low ERI and high HGS. Among the four groups classified by ERI and HGS values, the highest risk group was the high ERI/low HGS group (HR: 4.20 95% CI 2.12-8.33). CONCLUSIONS: EPO hyporesponsiveness combined with low HGS were found to be significant predictors of a poor outcome, and the synergistic effects of the two factors had stronger predictive ability than either single factor.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of updated information on premature death and years of potential life lost (YPLL) among human immunodeficiency (HIV)-positive women with cervical cancer. We hypothesize that increased access to preventive resources such as antiretroviral therapy, preexposure prophylaxis, and human papillomavirus vaccines has reduced premature mortality and YPLL in these women in the previous decades. METHODS: We used data from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2003 to the third quarter of 2015, and restricted the analysis to HIV-positive women with or without cervical cancer. Joinpoint regression models were run to identify trends in the rates of HIV and cervical cancer. Overall and age-stratified YPLL were calculated for HIV-positive women with cervical cancer. Adjusted survey logistic regression models were built to determine the predictive factors of in-hospital mortality among women living with HIV. RESULTS: Among hospitalized women, low-income, non-Hispanic Blacks, and patients aged 40 to 59 years experienced greater frequencies of HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. The prevalence of HIV hospitalizations increased by an average annual percentage of 0.9% (95% confidence interval 0.3-1.6). YPLL decreased in HIV-positive women living with and without cervical cancer by 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively. The trajectory for YPLL was not uniform across age groups. YPLL decreased substantially in women aged 20 to 29 years with HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. Cervical cancer remained a significant predictor of mortality among HIV-positive women when adjusted for age, race, and insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Within a large, national sample from 2003 to 2015, we found an overall declining trend in YPLL in women living with HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. In-hospital mortality among HIV-positive women was associated with cervical cancer, age, race, and insurance coverage.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Allergy to Anisakis simplex (s.) is spreading due to the increased consumption of raw, smoked or marinated fish. In man, Anisakis s. can directly attack the gastrointestinal mucosa, provoking a parasitosis known as anisakiasis, or giving rise to the formation of IgE and, finally, inducing IgE-mediated reactions like urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic shock. During recent years, a dietary approach to Anisakis s. infestation has also been addressed. METHODS: A total of 620 patients with urticaria, angioedema, or both and a history of anaphylaxis following consumption of raw, smoked or marinated fish were recruited, evaluated for specific IgE levels to Anisakis s. and subjected to Skin Prick test. Following 18 month fish-free diet, patients were reevaluated at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. Patients undergoing diet were selected among those who had a clinical history with multiple accesses to first aid. RESULTS: After 6-month fish-free diet, we recorded an improvement of symptoms and a remarkable reduction of specific IgE levels. The extension of the diet over 6 months in some cases resulted in a further reduction of specific IgE levels. CONCLUSION: Data obtained confirm the importance of a fish-free diet in patients with severe symptoms since a new antigenic exposure coincides with a relapse of symptoms and increased IgE levels. This last point should be kept in mind and carefully evaluated in patients at risk for anaphylaxis or angioedema.",

        "a": "Personal health records (PHRs) and patients' access to their own clinical information through a patient portal are changing the patient-physician relationship. Historically, health care providers have been gatekeepers of patients' medical records. Now, these portals provide patients access to clinical information, electronic messaging with the clinical team, and appointment and billing information. This type of access supports patient empowerment by engaging patients in their own care. Patients desire online access to information. The health care industry, like any other, must respond to the needs of its consumers. Oncology practices face unique challenges to meeting this need because of the complex nature of medical records of patients with cancer. Health care providers worry about the consequences of patients receiving \"bad news\" online, thereby increasing patient anxiety. This anxiety may, in turn, increase providers' workload by creating additional calls or visits to the office. These valid concerns require careful consideration when implementing a PHR or patient portal into a practice. Providers will benefit from a clear understanding of actual compared with potential risks and benefits. Much of the concerns about the negative effect on providers' workload and the potential increase in patients' anxiety have not been borne out. On the other hand, the implementation strategy, governance structure, and end-user education are crucial components to ensuring success. Successful implementation of a PHR or patient portal affords the opportunity to improve patient satisfaction and increase efficiency in provider workflow.

At a cutoff date (January 1st, 1997), a change from a primarily surgically based to a consequent multi-modality treatment regimen was implemented. The periods of time before and after that change should be compared. METHODS AND PATIENTS: The data of the DOSAK registry entries on 1038 patients suffering from primary untreated oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas were updated with respect to follow-up and mortality data to achieve a 100% quality of follow-up. The end point (death) was reached in 67% of the overall population. Statistical analysis was carried out by the Trium Analysis Online corporation, Munich. RESULTS: The portion of female and older tumor patients increased, more than half of all tumor patients were clearly in stage IV of the disease at first referral. The portion of patients operated on persisted approximately (80%), the portion of additional treatment modalities could be increased considerably. The fact of a bony infiltration by the tumor and the operability remained highly significantly relevant for survival in multivariate analysis, despite of multi-modality treatment. The survival rate of the patients remained significantly dependent on the clinical stage of the disease in multivariate analysis but could be improved by 10% in the clinical stages II and III and in the patients who could not be operated on. All in all, the cutoff date was statistically relevant for survival in multivariate analysis, i.[Symbol: see text]e. the change in the treatment regimen had a verifiable positive effect on the survival of a unicentric overall population. CONCLUSION: Survival improvement in an overall population via change in treatment strategy is possible in relatively short time; the clinical stages II and III and the non-operable patients have the greatest benefit from a multi-modality treatment.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) capture the postoperative period and reflect the patient's perspective of one's own recovery. However, it is unknown if PROs can reflect and predict the need for secondary surgeries after a primary hip arthroscopy. PURPOSE: To examine if PROs at 3 months and 1 year after primary hip arthroscopy were correlated with future reoperations and determine the critical thresholds for significant PROs utilizing a multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data on consecutive patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy between February 2008 and August 2018 was retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included for analysis if they had the following PROs preoperatively and at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Patients were split into 2 groups: those who underwent secondary surgery and those who did not. Patient variables, intraoperative labral treatment, preoperative PROs, and postoperative PROs were compared between the 2 groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis and ROC analysis were deployed to evaluate the correlation between PROs and the need for future surgery. RESULTS: A total of 911 primary arthroscopy cases were included in this study. While age, body mass index, labral treatment, and 3-month and 1-year follow-up mHHS, NAHS, and VAS were significant in the bivariate analysis, the multivariate logistic regression analysis only found 1-year mHHS to be significant in the final model (P < .05). The ROC curve for 1-year mHHS demonstrated acceptable discrimination between patients requiring secondary surgery and patients not requiring secondary surgery with an area under the curve of 0.73. Using the Youden index, a threshold of 80.5 was determined for the 1-year mHHS. CONCLUSION: The risk for secondary procedures may be evaluated with mHHS at 1 year after primary hip arthroscopy. Surpassing a score of 80.5 may be associated with a 74.4% reduction in risk for either a revision hip arthroscopy or a conversion to hip replacement.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Sixty-five patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy per a clinical care protocol developed in 1993. We reviewed our experience with the aim to identify clinicopathological predictors of disease recurrence. METHODS: All patients with CCA that underwent OLT at our institution between 1993 and January 1, 2006 were treated in accord with our published protocol. We analyzed multiple clinical and explant pathologic factors using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with CCA underwent OLT. Four patients died within six months due to postoperative complications. At last follow-up, 11 patients (17%) had developed recurrence seven to 64 months after OLT. Mean time to recurrence was 29 months, and eight patients had died from recurrent disease. Patient and disease-free survival were 76% and 60% five years after OLT. Predictors of recurrence were older age, pretransplant cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 >100 U/ml, prior cholecystectomy, mass on cross-sectional imaging, residual tumor in explant >2 cm, tumor grade and perineural invasion in explant. Underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis, percutaneous biliary intubation, gender, and other time points for CA 19-9 were not associated with recurrence. Prolonged staging-to-OLT intervals for patients transplanted after implementation of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) showed a trend toward increased recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients and those with high CA-19.9 levels, and larger tumors are more likely to develop recurrent disease. Prolonged waiting time may emerge as a significant risk factor with longer follow-up. These findings may guide patient selection, applicability of live donor transplantation and MELD score exceptions for this aggressive protocol.",

We investigated the relationship between this phenomenon and the SYNTAX score I in patients who had stable coronary artery disease. Our single-center study included 125 consecutive patients (109 men and 16 women; mean age, 54.3 \u00b1 9 yr) in whom coronary angiography revealed stable coronary artery disease. We calculated each patient's sleep-trough morning surge in systolic blood pressure, then calculated the SYNTAX score I. The morning surge was significantly higher in patients whose score was >22 (mean, 22.7 \u00b1 13.2) than in those whose score was \u226422 (mean, 12.4 \u00b1 7.5) (P <0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that morning surge in systolic blood pressure was the only independent predictor of an intermediate-to-high score (odds ratio=1.183; 95% CI, 1.025-1.364; P=0.021). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show an association between morning surge in systolic blood pressure and the SYNTAX score I in patients who have stable coronary artery disease.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Genetic variation in Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6), the major nicotine metabolizing enzyme, is associated with nicotine dependence and smoking cessation. Nicotine dependence severity also predicts smoking cessation. Our goals were to determine how CYP2A6 variation and nicotine dependence alter smoking cessation, and whether dependence could refine CYP2A6-based treatment recommendations. AIMS AND METHODS: Adult smokers treated for 12 weeks with placebo, nicotine patch, or varenicline (NCT01314001) were grouped as CYP2A6 normal (n = 567) or slow (n = 432) nicotine metabolizers based on a CYP2A6 weighted genetic risk score. Fagerstr\u00f6m test for nicotine dependence scores were measured at baseline and biochemically verified smoking cessation was assessed at end of treatment. RESULTS: Dependence neither mediated nor moderated an association between CYP2A6 variation and smoking cessation overall, within any treatment arm, or after stratifying by ancestry (n = 591 European, n = 408 African ancestry) or sex (n = 444 women, n = 555 men). In within-treatment analyses, the mediation effect odds ratio (OR) ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 and the bias-corrected 95% confidence interval contained 1. Moderation (i.e. interaction) effect ORs ranged from 0.88 to 1.61 (p = .397-.828). For CYP2A6 normal metabolizers, quit rates on varenicline were similar for those with high (41.1%) and low (43.4%) dependence, while quit rates were lower for those with high versus low dependence on both patch (16.5 vs. 29.7%) and placebo (8.9 vs. 18.5%). CYP2A6 slow metabolizers with high versus low dependence had lower quit rates in all three treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Although nicotine dependence severity neither mediated nor moderated CYP2A6 associations with smoking cessation, incorporating information on dependence may optimize the choice of smoking cessation treatment aid in CYP2A6 normal and slow metabolizers. IMPLICATIONS: Variation in CYP2A6 and nicotine dependence severity alter smoking cessation success. Our findings suggest that while nicotine dependence severity is unlikely to mediate or moderate CYP2A6 associations with cessation, incorporating patient information on both CYP2A6 and nicotine dependence severity may lead to improved smoking cessation strategies.",

However, the effectiveness of Flu/Bu4 for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains poorly understood. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed nationwide registry data in Japan from 2006 to 2018 and compared transplant outcomes of adult MDS patients receiving Flu/Bu4 and busulfan/cyclophosphamide (Bu4/Cy) using propensity score (PS) matching. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Among 2,482 MDS patients, 153 patients were assigned each to the Flu/Bu4 and Bu4/Cy groups. The 3-year OS rates were 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.8-60.8%) and 49.5% (95% CI, 40.8-57.6%) in the Flu/Bu4 and Bu4/Cy group, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.548). The 3-year progression-free survival (P\u2009=\u20090.858), the cumulative incidence of relapse (P\u2009=\u20090.536), and cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (P\u2009=\u20090.684) were not significantly different between the two groups. According to the findings of subgroup analyses, no patient had a favorable OS when using either of the two regimens. In conclusion, although our PS-matched cohort mainly comprised older patients who had a low hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index and low-risk disease status, Flu/Bu4 could be an alternative to Bu4/Cy for MDS patients prior to allo-HSCT.",

PURPOSE: To determine the frequency and embolus burden of PE in a consecutive oncologic patient group including symptomatic as well as incidental and initially unreported events. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective, single-center study from June 2005 to January 2010 all patients with an oncologic disease (ICD-10 code C00 to C96) that received at least one contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination of the chest were reviewed. The study group included 3270 patients with 6780 examinations. A validated pulmonary artery obstruction index (Mastora score) was used to assess embolus burden. RESULTS: PE was found in 240 of 3270 (7.3%) oncologic patients. The frequency was highly variable among different malignancies ranging from 0% to 25%. In the present study about half of all PE were unsuspected. The mean embolus burden was significantly higher in symptomatic PE than in unsuspected PE (P <0.001). The risk of developing a PE was 1.5 times higher in patients with metastases compared to patients without metastases (P <0.005). Age and sex had no influence on PE risk and embolus burden. CONCLUSION: PE is a frequent unsuspected finding in staging examinations: particularly in patients with malignancies of the ovary, brain, and pancreas, and in patients with metastases. Therefore, the status of the pulmonary vasculature should be assessed in every staging examination that includes the chest. The effect of therapeutic actions on PE events and the unsuspected finding of PE in follow-up CT examinations require further prospective studies.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Individualized education is important for preparing patients for the operation both physically and psychologically. This study investigated the effects of pre-operative individualized education for open-heart surgery patients on post-operative anxiety and pain severity. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a university hospital between January and October 2014 and involved 109 patients. Data were collected through a form developed by the authors, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the visual analog scale (VAS). Patients underwent STAI 1 day before the operation to identify their sources of anxiety and educational needs, and then individualized education was given accordingly. 1 day after the operation, STAI was used to measure patients' state anxiety level, and VAS was used to measure their pain level. The effect of demographic variables on differences in anxiety and pain was investigated. RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 59.62; 69.7% were male, 92.7% were married, 49.5% graduated from primary school, and the majority (71.6%) had coronary heart disease. The most common sources of anxiety reported the participants included lack of knowledge, being away from family, risk of death, and pain. An analysis of the participants' pre-operative mean scores for state anxiety displayed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) according to age groups and gender. No significant difference was detected between mean pre- and post-operative state anxiety scores. There was a statistically significant relationship between mean pre- and post-operative state anxiety scores and mean pain scores. CONCLUSIONS: The individualized education is given to patients before surgery was found to have potential effects on their post-operative pain levels.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The research on the effect of anesthesia on endovascular therapy (EVT) of acute ischemic stroke is mainly focused on the anterior circulation, and little is known about the data of basilar artery occlusion (BAO). This study aims to investigate the association of anesthesia strategy with 90-day clinical outcomes of patients with acute BAO treated with EVT. METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively collected data from the endovascular treatment database at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital. This included patients with acute BAO who had a documented 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score from January 2012 to July 2018. Options for EVT included general anesthesia (GA) and conscious sedation (CS) performed by an anesthesia care team in the institution. The recommendation of anesthesia for patients was a joint decision between anesthesiologist and neurointerventionalist according to a pre-designed scheme. Patients who required tracheal intubation for airway protection prior to EVT were excluded. The clinical outcomes we observed were functional independence (mRS \u22642), favorable outcome (mRS \u22643), and mortality at 90\u2009days after the procedure. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between anesthesia methods and 90-day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients with BAO were treated by EVT in this study. Nine cases requiring emergent intubation prior to EVT were excluded. 139 patients (78.1%) underwent GA and 39 patients (21.9%) underwent CS. In univariate analysis, GA was associated with less functional independence [odds ratio (OR), 0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-0.59] and less favorable outcome (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10-0.52) than was CS. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable analysis showed that there were still significant differences between GA and CS in functional independence (OR, 0.31; 95%CI, 0.10-0.97) and favorable outcome (OR, 0.24; 95%CI, 0.07-0.75). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective analysis suggested that the anesthesia strategy may affect outcome, in which general anesthesia may result in less favorable outcomes. Nevertheless, future multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of intensive versus standard nonsedating antihistamines (NSAs) for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients. METHODS: An electronic search was performed on the PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) throughout January 2021. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to calculate the pooled outcomes for the continuous and categorical data using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Nine RCTs involving 1,996 CSU patients were selected. We found that intensive NSA was associated with greater reduction in the mean pruritus score than the standard dose of NSA (WMD: -0.13; p = 0.005). However, there was no significant difference between the intensive and standard dose of NSA in terms of the rate of response to antihistamines (RR: 1.00; p = 0.865). Finally, the use of intensive NSA was associated with a higher risk of somnolence than the use of standard NSA (RR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.55-6.95; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We found that the use of intensive NSA could achieve greater reduction in the mean pruritus score, without increasing the risk of adverse events.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a type of encephalopathy mediated by an antigenic immune response in the central nervous system. Most research related to autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is focused on early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis analysis; there has been little research conducted on the characteristics of immune function, and the relationship between immune function and prognoses of patients with autoimmune encephalitis needs to be studied further. METHODS: A total of 33 children with autoimmune encephalitis were identified through the clinic database and inpatient consults at Tianjin Children's Hospital from January 2013 to January 2021. Based on the one-year follow-up and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prognosis score, they were divided into a good prognosis group and a poor prognosis group. The immune function characteristics of the two groups of children with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) were compared using Spearman correlation to analyse the mRS score and immune function indicators (IgA, IgG, IgM, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8), and binary logistic regression was used to analyse the independent risk factors of the prognoses in patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE). RESULTS: The differences in abnormal mental disorders and limb dyskinesia, cognitive impairment, onset types, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at admission, and immune function status during remission between the two groups were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: There is a close correlation between modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and the immune function index CD4/CD8 in children with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) when they are admitted to the hospital. A young age, disturbance of consciousness, limb dyskinesia, abnormal immune function in remission and anti-NMDAR encephalitis are risk factors for poor prognoses in children with autoimmune encephalitis (AE).

We sought to measure long-term survival in RAHD patients undergoing CTS, to compare them with a matched control population undergoing similar surgical procedures, and to identify potential predictors of long-term survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing CTS, matched on the basis of age, sex, and type/time of CTS, 173 RAHD patients (75% women; age, 63\u00b114 years) and 305 comparison patients (74% women; age, 63\u00b14 years) were included. The vast majority of RAHD patients had prior breast cancer (53%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and the mean time from radiation was 18\u00b112 years. Clinical and surgical parameters were recorded. The preoperative EuroSCORE and all-cause mortality were recorded. The mean EuroSCOREs were similar in the RAHD and comparison groups (7.8\u00b13 versus 7.4\u00b13, respectively; P=0.1). Proximal coronary artery disease was higher in patients with RAHD versus the comparison patients (45% versus 38%; P=0.09), whereas redo CTS was lower in the RACD versus the comparison group (20% versus 29%; P=0.02). About two thirds of patients in either group had combination surgical procedures. During a mean follow-up of 7.6\u00b13 years, a significantly higher proportion of patients died in the RAHD group than in the comparison group (55% versus 28%; P<0.001).

        "a": "PURPOSE: To examine the effect of kidney recovery on mortality, dialysis and kidney transplantation up to 15\u00a0years after AKI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 29,726 survivors of critical illness and compared these outcomes stratified by AKI and recovery status at hospital discharge. Kidney recovery was defined as a return of serum creatinine to \u2264150% of baseline without dialysis prior to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Overall AKI occurred in 59.2% in which two thirds developed stage 2-3 AKI. Recovery rate of AKI at hospital discharge was 80.8%. Patients who did not recover experienced the worst 15-year mortality compared to those who recovered and those without AKI (57.8% vs 45.2% vs 30.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This pattern was also found in subgroups of patients with suspected sepsis-associated (57.1% vs 47.9% vs 36.5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and cardiac surgery-associated AKI (60.1% vs 41.8% vs 25.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The rates of dialysis and transplantation at 15\u00a0years were low and not associated with recovery status. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of AKI in critically ill patients at hospital discharge had an effect on long-term mortality for up to 15\u00a0years.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Definitive staging for cervical (CC) and endometrial cancer (EC) takes place once surgery is performed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PET/CT in detecting lymphatic metastasis in patients with CC and EC using dual-time-point imaging (DPI), taking the histopathological results of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and lymphadenectomy as the reference. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 17 patients with early CC, and 13 patients with high-risk EC. The patients had a pre-operative PET/CT, MRI, SLN detection, and lymphadenectomy, when indicated. PET/CT findings were compared with histopathological results. RESULTS: In the pathology study, 4 patients with CC and 4 patients with EC had lymphatic metastasis. PET/CT showed hypermetabolic nodes in 1 patient with CC, and 5 with EC. Four of these had metastasis, one detected in the SLN biopsy. Four patients who had negative PET/CT had micrometastasis in the SLN biopsy, 1 patient with additional lymph nodes involvement. The overall patient-based sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of PET/CT to detect lymphatic metastasis was 20.0%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 87.9%, and 88.2%, respectively, in CC, and 57.1%, 88.9%, 66.7%, 84.2% and 80.0%, respectively, in EC. DPI showed higher retention index in malignant than in inflammatory nodes, although no statistically significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT has low sensitivity in lymph node staging of CC and EC, owing to the lack of detection of micrometastasis. Thus, PET/CT cannot replace SLN biopsy. Although no statistically significant differences were found, DPI may help to differentiate between inflammatory and malignant nodes.",

        "a": "Aims: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance (IR), is a prognostic risk factor in the general population. We aimed to assess whether it is an independent predictor of outcome also in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). Methods and results: TyG index was evaluated in 1097 consecutive patients (75% men, median age 72\u2009years) with known (26%) or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), undergoing stress-rest myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and coronary angiography and followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Moderate/severe perfusion abnormalities during stress (summed stress score >7) were documented in 60% of patients, obstructive CAD in 74%, and 36% underwent early revascularization. TyG index was 8.9 (median, interquartile interval 8.6-9.2). Cardiac death or myocardial infarction occurred in 103 patients and all-cause death in 65. After correction for clinical risk factors, LV function and common bio-humoral variables, TyG index (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.57-3.72, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and moderate/severe stress perfusion abnormalities (hazard ratio (HR) 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-3.77, P\u2009<\u20090.001) independently predicted cardiac events. TyG index (HR 3.64, 95%CI 2.22-5.96, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19, P\u2009=\u20090.002) independently predicted all-cause death. Conclusion: In patients with CCS, the TyG index identifies a cardiometabolic profile associated with an additional risk of cardiac events, over the presence of myocardial ischaemia and independently of other clinical, common bio-humoral or imaging risk determinants.",

        "a": "AIMS: To assess the value of plasma NT proBNP levels for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with DCM (EF <40%) with sinus rhythm were enrolled. All patients had undergone echocardiographic examination, coronary angiography, and cardiac catheterisation. Blood samples for plasma NT proBNP levels were taken at rest following echocardiographic examination. Patients were followed up for 660+/-270 days for clinical endpoints defined as; death from worsening heart failure, sudden cardiac death and heart transplantation (Tx). RESULTS: Clinical end points were observed in 19 patients (5 Tx, 4 sudden cardiac death, 10 death from worsening heart failure). Variables associated with an increased hazard of clinical endpoints in univariate analysis were log NT proBNP, age, NYHA functional class, left ventricle ejection fraction, mitral valve effective regurgitation orifice area, and E wave deceleration time. The plasma level of NT proBNP (Hazard ratio=2.5 [95% CI: 1.3-4.7], p=0.0024) and age (hazard ratio=0.94 [95% CI: 0.90-0.98], p=0.0005) were the independent variables associated with an increased risk of clinical endpoints. NT proBNP plasma level >4500 pg/ml detected patients with clinical endpoints with a sensitivity, and specificity of 72%, 80%, respectively. The event free survival was found to be significantly lower in patients with NT proBNP levels >4500 pg/ml. CONCLUSION: NT proBNP seems to be a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with DCM with sinus rhythm and may be used as a reliable biological marker in risk stratification.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (PD) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. The prevalence of women in correctional settings has grown eight-fold in the last 30 years. A quarter of these women were either pregnant or within a year postpartum when entering custody. Recommendations to screen and treat all pregnant women for PD are being implemented nationwide. LOCAL PROBLEM: In 2016, 71% of pregnant women entering Milwaukee County Jail had minimal or no prenatal care and significant rates of high-risk medical and social risk factors. The jail system was not screening for PD. METHODS: The Plan-Do-Study-Act method of quality improvement (QI), with four rapid cycles, was utilized. Patient tracer interviews and refusal rates were collected for baseline data two months preceding implementation. Data was analyzed using run charts to evaluate the impact of interventions on outcomes. INTERVENTION: PD screening was implemented with the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale, and if scored positive, the Healthwise shared decision-making tool was utilized for therapy options and treatment initiated. RESULTS: A total of 101 women were seen, 93 were offered screening, 76 were screened, 43 were positive, and 37 started treatment within the facility. That is, 46% to 57 % of this aggregate of women who screen positive for PD and a decrease in patient refusal rates was seen throughout the process. CONCLUSION: Rapid cycle QI was effective in standardizing PD screening and treatment. Replication of this project across correctional systems would help to bridge a gap of equitable care for incarcerated women.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of admission serum creatinine level on short-term outcomes in patients with acute STEMI undergoing DES-based primary PCI. METHODS: Primary PCI with DES implantation was attempted in 619 consecutive STEMI patients within 12 hours of symptom onset. Among them, 86 patients had a serum creatinine level > or = 115 micromol/L on admission (RD group), and the remaining 533 patients had normal renal function (non-RD group). The primary endpoint was 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE, including death, non-fatal reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization), and the secondary endpoint was subacute stent thrombosis. RESULTS: Patients in the RD group were older than those in the non-RD group. There are more female patients in the RD group and they had a history of hypertension, myocardial infarction and revascularization. The occurrence rates of Killip class > or = 2 (29.1% vs 18.6%, P = 0.02) and multi-vessel (62.8% vs 44.5%, P = 0.001) and triple vessel disease (32.6% vs 18.2%, P = 0.002), in-hospital mortality (9.3% vs 3.8%, P = 0.03), and MACE rate during hospitalization (17.4% vs 7.7%, P = 0.006) were higher in the RD group than those in the non-RD group. At a 30-day clinical follow-up, the MACE-free survival rate was significantly reduced in the RD group (76.7% vs 89.9%, P = 0.0003). Angiographic stent thrombosis occurred in 3 (3.5%) and 7 (1.3%) of patients in the RD group and non-RD group, respectively (P = 0.15). Multivariate analysis revealed that the serum creatinine level > or = 115 micromol/L on admission was an independent predictor for MACE rate at a 30-day follow-up (Hazard ratio (HR) 3.31, 95% CI 1.19 - 9.18, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite similar prevalence of stent thrombosis at a 30-day clinical follow-up, the short-term prognosis of STEMI patients with elevated serum creatinine on admission undergoing DES-based primary PCI remains unfavorable.",

Methionine loading could improve the predictive value of hyperhomocysteinaemia by detecting mild disturbances in enzyme activity. The aims of this study were to determine the beneficial effect of methionine loading on the predictive value of homocysteine testing for long-term mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). METHODS: In an observational study, 1122 patients with suspected or known vascular disease, underwent homocysteine testing, which was measured fasting and again 6 h after methionine loading. Hyperhomocysteinaemia was defined as a fasting level > or =15 micromol/L and post-methionine loading level > or =45 micromol/L or an increase of > or =30 micromol/L above fasting levels. Primary end-points were death and MACE. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used, adjusting for all cardiac risk factors. RESULTS: During follow up (mean 8.9 +/- 3.4 years), 98 patients died (8.7%), 86 had a MACE (7.7%), 579 patients had normal tests, 134 patients had only fasting hyperhomocysteinaemia, 226 only post-methionine hyperhomocysteinaemia and 183 patients had both. In multivariate analysis, overall survival and MACE-free survival were significantly worse for those with fasting hyperhomocysteinaemia, with hazard ratios of 1.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-2.87) and 2.24 (95%CI 1.41-3.53), respectively.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the reproducibility and impact of prostate imaging quality (PI-QUAL) scores in a clinical cohort undergoing prostate multiparametric MRI. METHODS: PI-QUAL scores were independently recorded by three radiologists (two senior, one junior). Readers also recorded whether MRI was sufficient to rule-in/out cancer and if repeat imaging was required. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using Cohen's \u03ba. PI-QUAL scores were further correlated to PI-RADS score, number of biopsy procedures, and need for repeat imaging. RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient (\u2265PI-QUAL-3) in 237/247 (96%) and optimal (\u2265PI-QUAL-4) in 206/247 (83%) of males undergoing 3T-MRI. Overall PI-QUAL scores showed moderate inter-reader agreement for senior (K = 0.51) and junior-senior readers (K = 0.47), with DCE showing highest agreement (K = 0.47). With PI-QUAL-5 studies, the negative MRI calls increased from 50 to 87% and indeterminate PI-RADS-3 rates decreased from 31.8. to 10.4% compared to lower quality PI-QUAL-3 studies. More patients with PI-QUAL scores 1-3 underwent biopsy for negative (47%) and indeterminate probability (100%) MRIs compared to PI-QUAL score 4-5 (30 and 75%, respectively). Ability to rule-in cancer increased with PI-QUAL score, from 50% at PI-QUAL 1-2 to 90% for PI-QUAL 4-5, with a similarly, but greater effect for ruling-out cancer and at a lower threshold, from 0% for scans of PI-QUAL 1-2 to 67.1% for PI-QUAL 4 and 100% for PI-QUAL-5. CONCLUSION: Higher PI-QUAL scores for image quality are associated with decreased uncertainty in MRI decision-making and improved efficiency of diagnostic pathway delivery. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study demonstrates moderate inter-reader agreement for PI-QUAL scoring and validates the score in a clinical setting, showing correlation of image quality to certainty of decision making and clinical outcomes of repeat imaging and biopsy of low-to-intermediate risk cases.",

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended annual skin testing for TB, with tuberculin-purified protein derivative (PPD), in patients with chronic renal failure. Uremia alters the macrophage function, which can lead to anergy for skin tests. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence of positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and the booster effect of TST in hemodialysis patients living in a relatively underdeveloped portion of the country. Material and Methods. Patients were recruited from Van (Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital, Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital) and the Mus State Hospital). At the time of this study, a total of 143 patients were under hemodialysis treatment in these hemodialysis centers, and among them, 124 were included in the study. Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study. A positive PPD was an induration of >10 mm in response to five tuberculin units of PPD (RT23-Tween 80), at 72 h. TST-negative patients received a booster TST 10 days later, approximately 10 cm away from the previous intracutaneous injection. The test dose could not be increased due to unavailability of this kind of preparation. The test was performed and interpreted in the same way. Skin testing was performed in June and December 2003.

The aim of this study was to assess the offloading efficacy of four different FOS models in comparison with a cast shoe and control shoe. METHODS: In-shoe plantar pressures were measured during walking in each of the six footwear conditions in 24 neuropathic diabetic patients at high risk for plantar foot ulceration. For each of six foot regions, peak pressure, pressure-time integral, and force-time integral were calculated. Load transfer diagrams were developed to assess the footwear mechanisms of action. Perceived walking comfort was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). All comparisons between conditions were tested at P<0.05. RESULTS: Peak pressures and pressure-time integrals at the metatarsal heads and hallux regions were significantly reduced (by 38-58%) in all FOS models when compared with the control shoe. The FOS also relieved metatarsal head peak pressure to a significantly larger extent than the cast shoe (approximately 20%). The load transfer diagrams showed a major transfer of approximately 40% of forefoot load to the midfoot explaining the offloading efficacy of the FOS. Perceived walking comfort was significantly lower in the FOS (VAS score 2.7-5.9) when compared with the control shoe (VAS 8.2) and cast shoe (VAS 6.8). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that all FOS models were effective in their primary goal, relieving forefoot pressure in at-risk neuropathic diabetic patients. Therefore, these shoes may be effective in offloading and healing plantar forefoot ulcers, although the low comfort scores should be considered as this may potentially affect adherence to treatment.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The extent of red blood cell units (RBC) needed for different neurosurgical procedures and the time point of their administration are widely unknown, which results in generously cross-matching prior to surgery. However, RBC are increasingly requested in the aging western populations, and blood donations are significantly reduced. Therefore, the knowledge of the extent and time point of administration of RBC is of major importance. METHODS: This is a retrospective single center analysis. The incidence of RBC transfusion during surgery or within 48\u00a0h after surgery was analyzed for all neurosurgical patients within 3\u00a0years. Costs for cross-matched and transfused RBC were calculated and risk factors for RBC transfusion analyzed. RESULTS: The risk of intraoperative RBC administration was low for spinal and intracranial tumor resections (1.87%) and exceeded 10% only in spinal fusion procedures. This was dependent on the number of fused segments with an intraoperative transfusion risk of >\u200912.5% with fusion of more than three levels. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significantly increased risk for RBC transfusion for female gender (p\u2009=\u20090.006; OR 1.655), higher age (N\u2009=\u20094812; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; OR 1.028), and number of fused segments (N\u2009=\u2009737; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; OR 1.433). Annual costs for cross-matching were 783,820.88 USD and for intraoperative RBC administration 121,322.13 USD. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical procedures are associated with a low number of RBC needed intraoperatively. Only elective spine fusion procedures with \u2265\u20093 levels involved and AVM resections seem to require cross-matching of RBC. The present data may allow changing the preoperative algorithm of RBC cross-matching in neurosurgical procedures and help to save resources and costs.",

Sixteen patients (64 %) underwent CEA within 14 days of IVT and the median interval between thrombolysis and CEA was 7.5 days (range, 3-50 days). One female patient died of a further intraoperative stroke within 30 days of surgery, yielding a mortality rate of 4 %. Two patients (8 %) suffered from cardiac complications postoperatively resulting in a short high dependency unit stay. Another two patients (8 %) developed local wound complications, which were managed conservatively without the need for re-operation. The median hospital length of stay was 4.5 days (range, 1-33 days). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that CEA post-thrombolysis has a low incidence of mortality. Further high quality evidence is required before CEA can be routinely recommended following IVT for acute ischaemic stroke.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with a concomitant asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm discovered at preoperative diagnostic imaging. METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2020, 75 consecutive patients admitted for surgical treatment of asymptomatic more than 70% (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) carotid artery stenosis presented at preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) with a concomitant, unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA). Aneurysm diameter was 5\u00a0mm or less in 25 patients (group A), from 6 to 9\u00a0mm in 38 patients (group B), and 10 or more mm in 12 patients (group C). Sixty UIAs (80%) were treated before performing CEA, 10 in group A (40%), 38 (100%) in group B, and 12 (100%) in group C. Twenty-five UIAs (42%) were subjected to surgical clipping and 35 (58%) to coiling. The mean time intervals were 48\u00a0days (range, 20-55\u00a0days) between clipping and CEA, and 8\u00a0days (range, 4 -13\u00a0days) between coiling and CEA. CEA was standard and performed through eversion of the internal carotid artery in 36 patients (48%) and through longitudinal arteriotomy with systematic patch closure in 39 patients (52%). The primary end points of the study were mortality and morbidity related to each of the two treatments, including any complication occurring during the time interval between the two procedures or within 30\u00a0days after the last procedure. Secondary end points were mid-term survival and freedom from ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and carotid restenosis. RESULTS: One patient died during the 30\u00a0days after the clipping of a 11-mm diameter UIA of the basilar artery. No other death or complication was observed after CEA and treatment of the UIA, or during the time interval between the two procedures. During a median follow-up of 26\u00a0months (interquartile range, 18-30\u00a0months), no late stroke and no carotid restenosis were observed. At 22, 27, 29 and 31\u00a0months after CEA, four patients in group A underwent surgical clipping of an enlarging intracranial aneurysm that had not been treated initially owing to its small diameter. The cumulative survival rate at 30\u00a0months by Kaplan-Meier plots was 83\u00a0\u00b1 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and UIA is a rare entity. Our study suggests that in this setting, prior treatment of the UIA followed by CEA is safe.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic CTA is a promising technique for visualization of collateral filling in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Our aim was to describe collateral filling with dynamic CTA and assess the relationship with infarct volume at follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected patients with acute ischemic stroke due to proximal MCA occlusion. Patients underwent NCCT, single-phase CTA, and whole-brain CT perfusion/dynamic CTA within 9 hours after stroke onset. For each patient, a detailed assessment of the extent and velocity of arterial filling was obtained. Poor radiologic outcome was defined as an infarct volume of \u226570 mL. The association between collateral score and follow-up infarct volume was analyzed with Poisson regression. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients with a mean age of 67 years were included. For all patients combined, the interval that contained the peak of arterial filling in both hemispheres was between 11 and 21 seconds after ICA contrast entry. Poor collateral status as assessed with dynamic CTA was more strongly associated with infarct volume of \u226570 mL (risk ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) than with single-phase CTA (risk ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5). Four subgroups (good-versus-poor and fast-versus-slow collaterals) were analyzed separately; the results showed that compared with good and fast collaterals, a similar risk ratio was found for patients with good-but-slow collaterals (risk ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7-2.4). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CTA provides a more detailed assessment of collaterals than single-phase CTA and has a stronger relationship with infarct volume at follow-up. The extent of collateral flow is more important in determining tissue fate than the velocity of collateral filling. The timing of dynamic CTA acquisition in relation to intravenous contrast administration is critical for the optimal assessment of the extent of collaterals.",

        "a": "Both, diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypercholesterolemia (HCH) are known as risk factors of ischemic heart disease, however, the effects of experimental DM, as well as of HCH alone, on ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury are not unequivocal. We have previously demonstrated an enhanced resistance to ischemia-induced arrhythmias in rat hearts in the acute phase of DM. Our objectives were thus to extend our knowledge on how DM in combination with HCH, a model that is relevant to diabetic patients with altered lipid metabolism, may affect the size of myocardial infarction and susceptibility to arrhythmias. A combination of streptozotocin (STZ; 80 mg/kg, i.p.) and the fat-cholesterol diet (1% cholesterol, 1% coconut oil; FCHD) was used as a double-disease model mimicking DM and HCH simultaneosly occurring in humans. Following 5 days after STZ injection and FCHD leading to increased blood glucose and cholesterol levels, anesthetized open-chest diabetic, diabetic-hypercholesterolemic (DM-HCH) and age-matched control rats were subjected to 6-min ischemia (occlusion of LAD coronary artery) followed by 10 reperfusion to test susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias in the in vivo experiments and to 30-min ischemia and subsequent 2-h reperfusion for the evaluation of the infarct size (IS) in the Langendorff-perfused hearts. The incidence of the most life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, was significantly increased in the DM-HCH rats as compared with non-diabetic control animals (100% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Likewise, arrhythmia severity score (AS) was significantly higher in the DM-HCH rats than in the controls (4.9+/-0.2 vs. 3.5+/-0.5; p<0.05), but was not increased in the diabetic animals (AS 3.7+/-0.9; p>0.05 vs. controls). Diabetic hearts exhibited a reduced IS (15.1+/-3.0% of the area at risk vs. 37.6+/-2.8% in the control hearts; p<0.05), however, a combination of DM and HCH increased the size of myocardial infarction to that observed in the controls. In conclusion, HCH abrogates enhanced resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury in the diabetic rat heart.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess long-term outcomes of facial pain and numbness after radiosurgery for multiple sclerosis (MS)-related trigeminal neuralgia (MS-TN). METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of their Gamma Knife radiosurgeries (GKRSs) to identify all patients treated for MS-TN (1998-2014) with at least 3 years of follow-up. Treatment and clinical data were obtained via chart review and mailed or telephone surveys. Pain control was defined as a facial pain score of I-IIIb on the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) Facial Pain Intensity Scale. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the rates of pain control after index and first salvage GKRS procedures. Patients could have had more than 1 salvage procedure. Pain control rates were based on the number of patients at risk during follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 50 living patients who underwent GKRS, 42 responded to surveys (31 women [74%], median age 59 years, range 32-76 years). During the initial GKRS, the trigeminal nerve root entry zone was targeted with a single isocenter, using a 4-mm collimator with the 90% isodose line completely covering the trigeminal nerve and the 50% isodose line abutting the surface of the brainstem. The median maximum radiation dose was 85 Gy (range 50-85 Gy). The median follow-up period was 78 months (range 36-226 months). The rate of pain control after the index GKRS (n = 42) was 62%, 29%, 22%, and 13% at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (67%) underwent salvage treatment, including 25 (60%) whose first salvage treatment was GKRS. The rate of pain control after the first salvage GKRS (n = 25) was 84%, 50%, 44%, and 17% at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The rate of pain control after the index GKRS with or without 1 salvage GKRS (n = 33) was 92%, 72%, 52%, 46%, and 17% at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively. At last follow-up, 9 (21%) of the 42 patients had BNI grade I facial pain, 35 (83%) had achieved pain control, and 4 (10%) had BNI grade IV facial numbness (very bothersome in daily life). CONCLUSIONS: Index GKRS offers good short-term pain control for MS-TN, but long-term pain control is uncommon. If the index GKRS fails, salvage GKRS appears to offer beneficial pain control with low rates of bothersome facial numbness.",

        "a": "In this editorial we comment on the article published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Gastroenterology [2022; 28 (19): 2123-2136]. We pay attention to how to construct a simpler and more reliable new clinical predictive model to early identify patients at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to early predict the severity of organ failure from chest computed tomography (CT) findings in SAP patients. As we all know, SAP has a sudden onset, is a rapidly changing condition, and can be complicated with ARDS and even multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and its mortality rate has remained high. At present, there are many clinical scoring systems for AP, including the bedside index for severity in AP, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, Japanese severe score, quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment, etc. However, some of these scoring systems are complex and require multiple and difficult clinical parameters for risk stratification. Although the aforementioned biomarkers are readily available, their ability to predict ARDS varies. Accor-dingly, it is extremely necessary to establish a simple and valuable novel model to predict the development of ARDS in AP. In addition, the extra-pancreatic manifestations of AP patients often involve the chest, among which pleural effusion and pulmonary consolidation are the more common complications. Therefore, by measuring the semi-quantitative indexes of chest CT in AP patients, such as the amount of pleural effusion and the number of lobes involved as pulmonary consolidation, it has important reference value for the early diagnosis of SAP complicated with ARDS and is expected to provide a basis for the early treatment of ARDS.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes, but it remains unclear which measure of frailty is best. This study compared two approaches: the Modified Frailty Index, which is a deficit accumulation model (number of accumulated deficits), and the Hopkins Frailty Score, which is a phenotype model (consisting of shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity). The primary aim was to compare the ability of each frailty score to predict prolonged hospitalization. Secondarily, the ability of each score to predict 30-day readmission and/or postoperative complications was compared. METHODS: This study prospectively enrolled adults presenting for preanesthesia evaluation before elective noncardiac surgery. The Hopkins Frailty Score and Modified Frailty Index were both determined. The ability of each frailty score to predict the primary outcome (prolonged hospitalization) was compared using a ratio of root-mean-square prediction errors from linear regression models. The ability of each score to predict the secondary outcome (readmission and complications) was compared using ratio of root-mean-square prediction errors from logistic regression models. RESULTS: The study included 1,042 patients. The frailty rates were 23% (Modified Frailty Index of 4 or higher) and 18% (Hopkins Frailty Score of 3 or higher). In total, 12.9% patients were readmitted or had postoperative complications. The error of the Modified Frailty Index and Hopkins Frailty Score in predicting the primary outcome was 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2, 2.9) and 2.6 (95% CI, 2.2, 3.0) days, respectively, and their ratio was 1.0 (95% CI, 1.0, 1.0), indicating similarly poor prediction. Similarly, the error of respective frailty scores in predicting the probability of secondary outcome was high, specifically 0.3 (95% CI, 0.3, 0.4) and 0.3 (95% CI, 0.3, 0.4), and their ratio was 1.00 (95% CI, 1.0, 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The Modified Frailty Index and Hopkins Frailty Score were similarly poor predictors of perioperative risk. Further studies, with different frailty screening tools, are needed to identify the best method to measure perioperative frailty.",

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus clones are widespread worldwide, and molecular epidemiological studies are important. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the characteristics of patients who died due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and microbiological characteristics of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains in a tertiary teaching hospital. This single-center, retrospective study included patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolated from blood bacterial culture performed at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Hospital, from October 2016 to May 2019. The data analyzed included patient background, clinical strain characteristics, and molecular epidemiology. Of 41 patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia (median age, 60 [28-70] years; 24 (59%) were men), and 7 (17%) died due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia. The median age of those who died in the methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia group was predominantly higher than that of those in the alive group (p = 0.03). The most common cause of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia was endovascular devices, which occurred in 20 (49%), 18 (53%), and 2 (29%) patients in the total, alive, and died groups, respectively. Bacteriological characteristics showed that type IV Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec genotype was most frequently detected in the total (n = 34 [83%]), alive (n = 29 [85%]), and died (n = 5 [71%]) groups. In the molecular cluster analysis, CC8, ST8, staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec type IV, and community-acquired-methicillin-resistant S. aureus formed the largest groups. The diversity of methicillin-resistant S. aureus clones is evident, and it is possible that clones with new virulence factors may still emerge. In the future, it will be crucial to monitor the epidemiological trends of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to respond quickly to changes in pathogenic and clonal factors, to clarify the gene expression network by identifying old and new virulence factors.",

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a nationwide, population-based prospective database, the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery. SETTING: A total of 166 voluntarily participating trauma centers (levels I-III). PATIENTS: Patients registered in the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery between 1993 and 2008 with complete data sets who presented with a relevant trauma load (Injury Severity Score of \u2265 9) and were admitted to an intensive care unit (n = 29,829). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over the 16-yr study period, 10.2% (3,042 of 29,829) of multiply injured patients developed sepsis during their hospital course. Annual data were summarized into four subperiods: 1993-1996, 1997-2000, 2001-2004, and 2005-2008. The incidences of sepsis for the four subperiods were 14.8%, 12.5%, 9.4%, and 9.7% (p < .0001), respectively. In-hospital mortality for all trauma patients decreased for the respective subperiods (16.9%, 16.0%, 13.7%, and 11.9%; p < .0001). For the subgroup of patients with sepsis, the mortality rates were 16.2%, 21.5%, 22.0%, and 18.2% (p = .054), respectively. The following independent risk factors for posttraumatic sepsis were calculated from a multivariate logistic regression analysis: male gender, age, preexisting medical condition, Glasgow Coma Scale score of \u2264 8 at scene, Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury ScaleTHORAX score of \u2265 3, number of injuries, number of red blood cell units transfused, number of operative procedures, and laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sepsis decreased significantly over the study period; however, in this decade the incidence remained unchanged. Although overall mortality from multiple trauma has declined significantly since 1993, there has been no significant decrease of mortality in the subgroup of septic trauma patients. Thus, sepsis has remained a challenging complication after trauma during the past 2 decades. Recognition of the identified risk factors may guide early diagnostic workup and help to reduce septic complications after multiple trauma.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The 5-year survival rate for individuals with neuroblastoma is approaching 70%. Few data exist, however, on the long-term outcomes of these patients, who are often treated at a very young age. METHODS: Outcome data were obtained for 954 5-year neuroblastoma survivors who were diagnosed in 1970-1986 and enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Late mortality, second malignant neoplasms, and chronic health conditions were analyzed in relation to treatment factors using Poisson regression models and their modification with generalized estimating equations. Neuroblastoma survivors were compared with a cohort of 3899 siblings of CCSS participants for risk of chronic health conditions and selected sociodemographic outcomes. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Six percent of patients died more than 5 years after their diagnosis (standardized mortality ratio = 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4 to 6.9). The most common causes of death were disease recurrence (n = 43) and second malignant neoplasms (n = 13). The cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms was 3.5% at 25 years and 7.0% at 30 years after diagnosis. Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors had an increased risk of selected chronic health conditions (risk ratio [RR] = 8.3; 95% CI = 7.1 to 9.7) with a 20-year cumulative incidence of 41.1%. The most prevalent outcomes involved the neurological, sensory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems, with 20-year cumulative incidences of 29.8%, 8.6%, 8.3%, and 7.8%, respectively. Neuroblastoma survivors who were treated with multimodality therapy were more likely to develop a chronic health condition than survivors treated with surgery alone (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.0). Neuroblastoma survivors were less likely than siblings to have ever been employed (P = .04) or to be married (P < .001) and had a lower personal income (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Neuroblastoma survivors have an increased rate of mortality and second malignant neoplasms, relative to the age- and sex-comparable US population, and of chronic health conditions, relative to their siblings, which underscores the need for long-term medical surveillance.",

We used the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II system to evaluate ICU performance. METHODS: The present study is a prospective observational study in an ICU at Vilnius University Emergency Hospital, Lithuania. The observed death rate was compared with the predicted death rate calculated using SAPS II system. The ability of the SAPS II prognostic system to predict the probability of hospital mortality was assessed with discrimination and calibration measures. RESULTS: Two-thousand-and-sixty-seven patients consecutively admitted to the ICU were studied. The median SAPS II score on the first ICU day was 29. The SAPS II system showed a good ability to separate those patients predicted to live from those predicted to die (an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.883). The calibration curve demonstrated under-prediction of the actual death rate (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, chi2 = 56.98; df = 8; P < 0.001). The observed mortality was higher than predicted by the SAPS II equation (observed to predicted ratio is 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The SAPS II system is a useful tool for the assessment of ICU performance. This system demonstrated a good ability of discrimination, but an under-prediction of the actual mortality rate, in Lithuanian ICUs.",

        "a": "The evolution of radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer has been striking over the last 10 years. Advances in brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and the combination of EBRT + BT have led to improved biochemical and clinical results. This article describes these advances in the context of the treatment decision process. Key to this process is the assignment of patient risk, which is based on the results of conventional radiation dose and techniques. Using the 1992 AJCC palpation staging system, Gleason score, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, two different risk assessment algorithms were compared. Both gave comparable approximations of risk, although the single factor high-risk model was superior in differentiating those patients with the highest probability of failing treatment after radiotherapy. Such criteria are the foundation for treatment selection. Objective findings support BT alone or EBRT alone for low-risk patients, high-dose EBRT or EBRT + BT for intermediate-risk patients, and EBRT + androgen deprivation for high-risk patients. In summary, advances in radiation oncology have led to significant gains in prostate cancer control. Clinical prognostic factor-based patient selection is central to the optimization of outcome.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: We developed a quantitative nutritional score, based on biochemical measures, taken as part of monthly routine care. The\u00a0score can be accomplished within a short time after routine laboratory results completion and identify a monthly change in nutritional\u00a0status. DESIGN: A longitudinal observational cohort study SETTING: The Institute of Nephrology, Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel. SUBJECTS: A total of 179 hemodialysis patients were followed up for up to 2.5\u00a0years after study baseline. INTERVENTION: The Integrative Clinical Nutrition Dialysis Score (ICNDS) is based on the biochemical measures of albumin, creatinine, urea, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, dialysis adequacy, and weight change. Each parameter is ranked between 1 and 5, with the higher rank derived from recommended National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease/Dialysis Outcomes and Quality Initiative values and the lower rank indicating deviation from those values. The final ICNDS is the sum of ranks over 7 parameters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for association between subjective global assessment and ICNDS in 63 randomly selected patients. In 179 dialysis patients, the baseline ICNDS, the slope of 3 subsequent monthly ICNDS values, were tested for their correlation with odds of all-cause mortality, hospitalization frequency, length of stay, after 31\u00a0months. Spline Cox regression was used to select the best cutoff point, associated with severe mortality risk. RESULTS: Score results were significantly correlated with nutrition evaluation by subjective global assessment (r\u00a0=\u00a00.842, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). For a unit increase in baseline score, death odds were significantly decreased (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.929, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.974, P\u00a0<\u00a0.002). Each unit increase in slope significantly reduced mortality risk (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.485, 95% CI 0.278-0.847, P\u00a0<\u00a0.011). Hospitalization frequency was significantly increased across worsening baseline score (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.935, 95% CI 0.906-0.964, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). A 1-unit increase in slope significantly decreased hospitalization (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.799, 95% CI 0.726-0.881, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm that ICNDS is a useful prognostic tool that serves to detect nutrition deterioration at its very beginning.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of ventilation-perfusion scintillation scans, obtained during the pre-transplant period, to identify patterns that predict prognosis while on the waiting list. These patterns were compared with other pulmonary physiologic markers of ventilation and perfusion obtained from pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise tests. METHODS: From November 1990 to January 1999, 46 patients with cystic fibrosis were listed for bilateral lung transplantation. Fourteen (30.4%) died while waiting for a transplant (Group 1), whereas 32 were transplanted successfully or remain alive and waiting (Group 2). Mean arterial blood gas values, Brasfield radiograph scores, cardiopulmonary exercise data and the degree of scintillation scan abnormalities between lungs were compared for each group. RESULTS: Mean survival for Group 1 was 10.2 +/- 1.7 months, and for Group 2 was 23.5 +/- 3.0 months (p < 0.001). The right upper lung zone was the most severely affected segment. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed an increased perfusion disparity and resting hypercapnia as the main predictors of death while on the transplant list. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated greater survival for the groups with <30% disparity between lungs on the pre-transplant scintillation scans. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that severe, unilateral perfusion abnormalities seen on scintillation scans in patients with cystic fibrosis are associated with an increased risk of dying while on the lung transplant waiting list and may be helpful in identifying patients who should be considered for early or living-donor transplantation.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The benefits of minimally invasive versus open thymectomy for the management of thymoma are debatable. Further, patient factors contributing to the selection of operative technique are not well elucidated. We aim to identify the association between baseline patient characteristics with choice of surgical approach. METHODS: Medical records of early stage thymoma (stages I and II) patients undergoing thymectomy between 2005 and 2015 at a single center were identified. Baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes such as prolonged length of stay (LOS \u2265 4 days), 90-day postoperative morbidity, completeness of resection, and recurrence or mortality free rates were compared by surgical approach. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients underwent thymectomy (34 open [64.15%] vs. 19 minimally invasive [35.85%]). There were no statistical differences between the two surgical approaches in demographic variables, smoking status, lung function, comorbidity, tumor size, or staging. Open thymectomy had significantly prolonged LOS (\u22654 days) compared with minimally invasive procedures (odds ratio: 11.65; p\u2009<\u20090.01). There were no significant differences in postoperative composite morbidity (p\u2009=\u20090.56), positive margin (p\u2009=\u20090.40), tumor within 0.1 cm of resection margin (p\u2009=\u20090.38), and survival probability estimates (log rank test; p\u2009=\u20090.48) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Baseline patient characteristics were not associated with surgical approach selected for thymectomy. Minimally invasive thymectomy patients had shorter LOS but no significant differences in 90-day composite morbidity and recurrence or mortality. Larger multicenter studies are needed to evaluate factors contributing to patient selection for each approach, which may include surgeon preference.",

        "a": "Heart failure (HF), affecting an increasing number of patients, is associated with several diagnostic, therapeutic, socioeconomic problems. Despite considerable advances, prognosis in HF--both in systolic failure and in that with preserved systolic function--is poor, which in part results from not the fully understood pathophysiology of this disease, and therapeutic approaches used at present. Until recently, efforts of researchers focused on the development of effective therapeutic methods in more advanced stages of the disease, but their results were disappointing. Currently, more emphasis is placed on broadly understood methods of HF prevention. When starting HF treatment upon objective confirmation of the diagnosis, there are some primordial goals to be remembered, that if achieved, may translate into postponing the prospect of death and improving the patient's quality of life. Therapy of HF employs pharmaceuthical agents that reduce mortality (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists) and attenuate symptoms (diuretics, digoxin, inotropes). Intensification of therapy depends on the functional NYHA class. In recent years, fate of patients with advanced HF has improved through the use of electrotherapy (cardioverters-defibrillators and [or] resynchronization devices). The key issue is to develop a uniform model of healthcare for HF patients, focused on an outpatient clinic system rather than a hospital.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To test whether vital exhaustion overlaps more with somatic/affective depression than with cognitive/affective depressive symptoms and evaluate the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events associated with these constructs. METHODS: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Maastricht Questionnaire (MQ) were administered to 528 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction (MI). Principal component analyses (PCAs) were performed to assess the structure of the BDI, the MQ, and both combined. Univariate and multivariate (adjusting for age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, Killip Class, and history of MI) Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events associated with the subscales of the MQ and of both questionnaires together. RESULTS: PCA on the MQ yielded only one dimension. Per-standard-deviation increase in total MQ score, the multivariate hazard ratio was 1.37 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.64, p < .001). PCA on the items of MQ and BDI together yielded two dimensions: a somatic/affective and a cognitive/affective dimension. All but two of the items of the MQ loaded on the somatic/affective dimension. The multivariate hazard ratio for recurrent events associated with a 1-standard deviation increase in the somatic/affective dimension was 1.39 (CI = 1.11-1.73, p = .004), which was higher than the risk associated with the cognitive/affective dimension (1.02, CI = 0.82-1.27, p = .83).

To understand the role of lincRNAs in the rare neuroendocrine tumors pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), we performed first time in-depth characterization of lincRNA expression profiles and correlated findings to clinical outcomes of the disease. RNA-Seq data from patients with PCPGs and 17 other tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other published sources were obtained. Differential expression analysis and a machine-learning model were used to identify transcripts specific to PCPGs, as well as established PCPG molecular subtypes. Similarly, lincRNAs specific to aggressive PCPGs were identified, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for metastasis-free survival. The results were validated in independent samples using RT-PCR. From a pan-cancer context, PCPGs had a specific and unique lincRNA profile. Among PCPGs, five different molecular subtypes were identified corresponding to the established molecular classification. Upregulation of 13 lincRNAs was found to be associated with aggressive/metastatic PCPGs. RT-PCR validation confirmed the overexpression of four lincRNAs in metastatic compared to non-metastatic PCPGs. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified five lincRNAs as prognostic markers for metastasis-free survival of patients in three subtypes of PCPGs. Stratification of PCPG patients with a risk-score formulated using multivariate analysis of lincRNA expression profiles, presence of key driver mutations, tumor location, and hormone secretion profiles showed significant differences in metastasis-free survival. PCPGs thus exhibit a specific lincRNA expression profile that also corresponds to the established molecular subgroups and can be potential marker for the aggressive/metastatic PCPGs.",

Identifying factors associated with the progression of early-stage BC can help understand the risk of metastasis and guide treatment decisions. Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), which is involved in the cellular antiviral mechanism, plays a role in some solid tumours; however, its role in invasive BC remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of MX1 in BC. METHODS: MX1 was assessed at the protein level using tissue microarrays from a large well-annotated BC cohort (n\u2009=\u2009845). The expression of MX1 mRNA was assessed at the transcriptomic level using the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC; n\u2009=\u20091980) and validated using three publicly available cohorts on Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (bc-GenExMiner version 4.4). The associations between MX1 expression and clinicopathological factors, and outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: High MX1 protein expression was associated with features of aggressiveness, including large tumour size, high tumour grade, high Nottingham prognostic index scores, hormone receptor negativity and high Ki67 expression. High MX1 expression showed an association with poor patient outcome and it was an independent predictor of short BC-specific survival (p\u2009=\u20090.028; HR\u2009=\u20091.5; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.0-2.2). Consistent with the protein results, high MX1 mRNA levels showed an association with features of aggressive behaviour and with shorter survival. CONCLUSION: This study identified MX1 as an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with BC. Further functional studies are needed to investigate the biological role of MX1 in BC and its potential value as a therapeutic target.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are common in cirrhosis with antibiotics frequently used to prevent infections, but their efficacy for this role is unknown. To investigate this, we used Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure (ATTIRE) data to evaluate whether antibiotic use in patients without infection prevented HAI. METHODS: In ATTIRE patients without infection at baseline grouped by antibiotic prescription or not, we studied HAI during trial treatment period and mortality, with propensity score matching to account for differences in disease severity. RESULTS: Two hundred three of 408 patients prescribed antibiotics at enrollment did not have infection and they were more unwell than noninfected patients not given antibiotics. There were no differences in subsequent HAI comparing antibiotic treated (39/203, 19.2%) to nonantibiotic treated (73/360, 20.3%; P = 0.83). Twenty-eight-day mortality was higher in antibiotic-treated patients ( P = 0.004) likely reflecting increased disease severity. Matching groups using propensity scoring revealed no differences in HAI or mortality. In noninfected patients at enrollment treated with/without rifaximin, there were no differences in HAI ( P = 0.16) or mortality, confirmed with propensity matching. Patients given long-term antibiotic prophylaxis at discharge had no differences in 6-month mortality compared with nonantibiotic patients, although antibiotic-treated patients had more infections at trial entry, with numbers too small for matching. DISCUSSION: Half of antibiotics at study entry were given to patients without an infection diagnosis which did not reduce the overall risk of HAI or improve mortality. This supports prompt de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics guided by culture sensitivities at 24-48 hours after commencement if no infection and the patient is improving.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal visual outcomes after surgery of CRP and determine the prognostic factors thereof. METHODS: One hundred forty-six adult patients who underwent surgery for newly diagnosed CRP were retrospectively reviewed. There were 87 male patients (60%), and the median age was 41 years (range, 18-75). The mean follow-up duration was 88.7 months (range, 24-307). A visual impairment score was used to assess the short-term (<1 month) and long-term (>2 years) visual outcomes. RESULTS: Gross total removal was performed in 53 patients (36%), and tumor recurrence occurred in 40 patients (27%). The average preoperative, short- and long-term visual impairment scores were 44.4, 38.5, and 38.1, respectively, on a 0- to 100-point scale (with 100 indicating the worst vision). Short- and long-term VD occurred in 28 (19%) and 39 patients (27%), respectively. Subtotal removal (STR) alone (P = .010; OR = 4.8), short-term VD (P < .001; OR = 39.7), and tumor recurrence (P < .001; OR = 28.2) were significant risk factors for long-term VD in the multivariate analysis. Patients undergoing STR alone had higher tumor recurrence rates in comparison with those who underwent gross total removal or STR with adjuvant therapy (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Short-term VD secondary to the surgical insult and the recurrence of the tumor were strong predictors of long-term visual outcomes after surgical treatment for CRP. STR alone may be an ineffective strategy for achieving tumor control and optimal visual outcomes in patients with CRP.",

Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM10) (0.6-2.2\u03bcgm-3, median: 0.9\u03bcgm-3) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1-2.8\u00d7103pcm-3, median: 0.67\u00d7103pcm-3) concentrations were significantly lower (p<0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7-10.2\u03bcgm-3, median: 8.0\u03bcgm-3 for PM10 and 12.1-22.2\u00d7103pcm-3, median: 16.4\u00d7103pcm-3 for PN). In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background. We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM10 concentrations from 0.1\u00d7103 to 100\u00d7103pcm-3, and from 2\u03bcgm-3 to 70\u03bcgm-3, respectively. The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. The average PM10 and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41mgmin-1 and from 1.20 to 3.96pmin-1\u00d71011, respectively. Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms. The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified. Based on the findings from the study, we developed a set of practical recommendations for PICU design, as well as for medical and cleaning staff to mitigate aerosol generation and transmission to minimize infection risk to PICU patients.",

        "a": "WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Low levels of serum triiodothyronine (T3) are a strong predictor of mortality and poor prognosis in critical care patients. Few reports, however, have focused on neurocritical patients. The application of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the treatment of neurocritical patients with low T3 syndrome remains controversial. We studied the role of low T3 state as a predictor of outcomes in neurocritical patients and examined the effect of HRT on prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the data of 32 neurocritical patients with low T3 syndrome who were admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2012 and October 2018. While 18/32 (56.25%) patients received HRT (HRT group; n\u00a0=\u00a018), 14/32 (43.75%) patients did not receive HRT (non-HRT group; n\u00a0=\u00a014). Patients were followed up for periods ranging from 3\u00a0months to 72\u00a0months. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U tests or the t tests. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve and compared by log-rank tests. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with prognosis and estimate the effect of HRT. We also assessed the influence of HRT on final neurological function, using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The neurocritical events in our cohort included post-operative complications (n\u00a0=\u00a018), traumatic brain injury (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Mean GCS score in the cohort was 6.41 (6.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.14 in HRT group vs 6.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.06 in non-HRT group). A total of 15/32 (46.87%) deaths were recorded (7 in the HRT group, 8 in the non-HRT group). In the HRT group, 15 patients underwent repeat thyroid function tests after completion of HRT; the low T3 situation was corrected in only 5/15 (33.3%) patients. Overall survival was significantly shorter in the non-HRT group than in the HRT group (16.45\u00a0months vs 47.47\u00a0months; P\u00a0=\u00a0.034). In univariate regression analysis, the HRT group has the lower mortality risk than the non-HRT group (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.301, 95% Cl: 0.094-0.964; P\u00a0=\u00a0.043). However, multivariate regression analysis showed no significant difference in mortality risk between the two groups (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.340 95% CI: 0.099-1.172; P\u00a0=\u00a0.087). There was no significant difference in effects of HRT on the short- and long-term neurological function between the groups. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Low T3 syndrome may influence the prognosis of neurocritical patients, attention should be paid to the changes in serum T3 levels during treatment. Although it is unclear to what extent HRT can improve the short or long-term outcomes of neurological function, it can significantly improve the survival rates of neurocritical patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are known to have a high risk of stroke and bleeding. We investigated the effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in octogenarian patients with non-valvular AF compared with warfarin. METHODS: A total of 687 octogenarian patients with AF who were administered NOACs (n = 403) or warfarin (n = 284) for stroke prevention between 2012 and 2016 were included. Thromboembolic (TE) events (stroke or systemic embolism), major bleeding events, and all-cause death were analyzed. RESULTS: The NOACs group (age 83.4\u00b13.2 years, women 52.4%, CHA2DS2-VASc score 5.0\u00b11.8) comprised 141 dabigatran, 158 rivaroxaban, and 104 apixaban users. Most patients from the NOACs group had been prescribed a reduced dose of medication (85.6%). During 14\u00b118 months of follow-up periods, there were 19 TE events and 18 major bleeding events. Patients with NOAC showed a lower risk of TE (1.84 vs. 2.71 per 100 person-years, hazard ration [HR] 0.134, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.038-0.479, P = 0.002), major bleeding (1.48 vs. 2.72 per 100 person-years, HR 0.110, 95% CI 0.024-0.493, P = 0.001), and all-cause death (2.57 vs. 3.50 per 100 person-years, HR 0.298, 95% CI 0.108-0.824, P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: In octogenarian Asian patients with AF, NOACs might be associated with lower risks of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and all-cause death than warfarin. Although most patients had received reduced doses, on-label use of NOACs was effective and safe.",

        "t": "Interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap).",
        "a": "BACKGROUND: Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (ISD) is a chronic, inflammatory, scaling skin condition, which causes redness and a greasy scaling rash in infants and young children. It can last from weeks to months, but rarely years. When it occurs on the scalp, it is referred to as 'cradle cap'. While benign and self-limiting, irrelevant of its location on the body, it can distress parents. The effectiveness of commonly promoted treatments is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis in children from birth to 24 months of age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 22 May 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies for further references to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched for unpublished RCTs and grey literature via web search engines, and wrote to authors and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of interventions for ISD in children from birth up to 24 months who were clinically diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner with ISD or cradle cap. We allowed comparison of any treatment to no treatment or placebo, and the comparison of two or more treatments or a combination of treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Change in severity score from baseline to end of study' and 'Percentage of infants treated who develop adverse effects or intolerance to treatment'. The secondary outcome was 'Improvement in quality of life (QoL) as reported by parents'. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs (one with a cross-over design) randomising 310 children and reporting outcomes for 297 children. Most participants were aged under seven months with only two participants aged over one year (seven and 12 years old); where specified, 60% were boys. In two studies, condition severity was mild to moderate; one study included two participants with severe ISD; the other studies did not describe baseline severity or described it as body surface area affected.The study setting was not always clear but likely a paediatric outpatient clinic in the following countries: Thailand, Israel, USA, France, and Australia.Two studies compared oral biotin (a B group vitamin) against placebo, two studies compared proprietary products against placebo cream or a control shampoo, and two studies compared topical corticosteroids against other products. The studies were generally short-term, between 10 and 42 days' duration; only one study followed the participants until resolution of the rash or eight months of age.We assessed the risk of bias as unclear for most aspects due to lack of reporting, but two of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias due to the appearance of the intervention, the trial design (open-label), or use of overlabelled tubes. Two trials had a high risk of attrition bias.All the results given below were based on very low-quality evidence. Treatment duration ranged from one week to three weeks.For the two trials comparing biotin versus placebo (n = 35), one did not report a measure of change in severity (only change in duration of rash) while the other did not report raw data (only 'no statistically significant difference'), measured at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events.Two trials compared proprietary products against placebo (n = 160). One trial assessed change in severity via percentage success (96% of participants in non-steroidal cream Promiseb versus 92% in placebo), and reported no adverse events (both assessed at day 14). The other trial assessed change in severity via reduction in lesional score (surface area covered), finding better results for lactamide MEA gel (a moisturising agent) plus shampoo (81.4%) compared with shampoo only (70.2%; P = 0.0092). No adverse events were described, but signs of discomfort were similar in both groups (both assessed at day 21).In the comparison of topical steroids versus another product, change in severity was measured through evaluation of cure and body surface (n = 102).In one trial comparing hydrocortisone 1% lotion with licochalcone 0.025% lotion, there was no significant difference in participants cured (95.8% with hydrocortisone compared to 97.1% with licochalcone). One person in the licochalcone group developed more erythema, but there were no other adverse events (both outcomes assessed at day 14). In the trial comparing flumethasone pivalate 0.02% ointment versus eosin 2% aqueous solution, a reduction in body surface area affected was seen in both groups at day 10 (9% with corticosteroid versus 7% with aqueous solution), with all infants showing less than 10% involvement. There were no adverse events (both outcomes assessed at day 10).No studies measured QoL.We found no trials testing commonly used treatments such as mineral oils, salicylic acid, or antifungals. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review identified only a limited number of studies investigating the effects of interventions for ISD in infants and young children. Unlike the reviews investigating the effects of treatments in adults, our results showed that there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and safety of studied treatments due to the very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons and outcomes.We assessed most bias domains as at unclear risk, but there was a high risk of bias for (mainly) performance, attrition, and detection bias. Evidence was limited further by imprecision (small studies, low number of events), indirectness (mainly with the outcomes assessed), and poor trial reporting. In most studies, the prognosis for the condition was favourable regardless of intervention but interpretation is limited by the very low-certainty evidence.Further research is needed with large, well-conducted, and well-reported intervention trials, particularly of interventions commonly recommended or used, such as emollients or shampoos and brushing, antifungals, or steroids. All studies should report standardised and validated relevant outcome measures, including adverse events, severity, and QoL, and they should be conducted in primary care settings where the majority of ISD is managed. Future trials should compare against placebo, no treatment, or standard care.",

However; the prognostic value for incident stroke remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of CACS obtained by non-contrast electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography for incident stroke. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane databases for prospective longitudinal studies of CACS which reported the incidence of stroke. Incidence of stroke was compared in patients with and without coronary calcification. RESULTS: Three studies evaluated 13,262 asymptomatic patients (mean age=60years, 50% men) without apparent cardiovascular diseases. During a follow-up of 7.2years (median 5years, range 4.4-9.5years, 95,434patient-years), the overall pooled incidence of stroke was 0.26%/year. The pooled risk ratio of CACS>0 for incident stroke was 2.95 (95% CI: 2.18-4.01, p<0.001) compared to CACS=0. The heterogeneity among studies was low (I2=0%). The pooled incidence rate of stroke categorized by CACS was 0.12%/year for CACS 0, 0.26%/year for CACS 1-99, 0.41%/year for CACS 100-399 and 0.70%/year for CACS \u2265400. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients without apparent cardiovascular diseases, the incidence of stroke was overall low. The presence and severity of coronary artery calcification were associated with incident stroke over mid-long term follow-up.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Data on the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) morphological and functional parameters including LV rotation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) are currently scarce. In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS) and LV torsion using CMR feature tracking (FT). METHODS: CMR was performed in 350 DCM patients and 70 healthy subjects across 5 different European CMR Centers. Myocardial strain parameters were retrospectively assessed from conventional balanced steady-state free precession cine images applying FT. A combined primary endpoint (cardiac death, heart transplantation, aborted sudden cardiac death) was defined for the assessment of clinical outcome. RESULTS: GLS, GCS, GRS and LV torsion were significantly lower in DCM patients than in healthy subjects (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). The primary endpoint occurred in 59 (18.7%) patients [median follow-up 4.2 (2.0-5.6) years]. In the univariate analyses all strain parameters showed a significant prognostic value (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the multivariate model, LV strain parameters, particularly GLS provided an incremental prognostic value compared to established CMR parameters like LV ejection fraction and late gadolinium enhancement. A scoring model including six categorical variables of standard CMR and strain parameters differentiated further risk subgroups. CONCLUSION: LV strain assessed with CMR FT has a high prognostic value in patients with DCM, surpassing routine and dedicated functional parameters. Thus, CMR strain imaging may contribute to the improvement of risk stratification in DCM.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence, indications, and risk factors for emergency department visits that do not result in readmission within 30 days of hysterectomy for benign disease. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of hysterectomies for benign disease using the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, a statewide group of hospitals that voluntarily reports perioperative outcomes. Hysterectomies for benign disease were abstracted from January 1, 2013, to July 2, 2014. We examined the incidence of emergency department visits within 30 days after hysterectomy for benign disease and constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for these visits. We focused on emergency department visits that did not result in readmission because they are more likely to represent avoidable encounters. RESULTS: Among the 10,274 women who underwent hysterectomy for benign disease during the study period, 932 (9.1%) presented to the emergency department and were not readmitted to the hospital. Based on a multivariable regression model, risk factors for emergency department visits after hysterectomy for benign disease were younger age, higher parity, Medicaid or self-pay insurance, prior venous thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative surgical indication of chronic pelvic pain, and postoperative day 1 pain scores greater than 4 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. The most common primary emergency department International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnoses were for pain (29.5% [n=275]), gastrointestinal (12.8% [n=118]), and genitourinary (10.7% [n=99]) complaints. CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 11 women present to the emergency department, but do not result in readmission within 30 days of hysterectomy for benign disease. Emergency department visits might be avoided with expanded perioperative education and improved communication pathways for high-risk patients.",

All-comer patients admitted to the emergency department of Modena University Hospital from 16 March to 31 December 2020 and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia infection were included in the study. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Out of 902 patients, 637 (70.6%) presented a baseline 12-lead ECG registration; of these, 122 (19.2%) were diagnosed with ARs. Atrial fibrillation (AF, 40.2%) was the most frequent AR detected. The primary endpoint (30-day mortality) occurred in 33.6% (p &lt; 0.001). AR-patients presented an almost 3-fold risk of mortality compared to non-AR-patients at 30d (Adj. OR = 2.8, 95%CI: 1.8-4.3, p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for significant baseline characteristics selected by a stepwise backward selection, AR-patients remained at increased risk of mortality (Adj. HR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.9-2.3, p &lt; 0.001). Sub-group analysis revealed that among ARs patients, those with AF at admission presented the highest risk of 30-day mortality (Adj. HR = 3.1, 95%CI: 2.0-4.9, p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, ARs are a quite common manifestation in COVID-19 patients, who are burdened by even worse prognosis.

In this study, we compared the risk of recurrent PUB between patients with and those without COPD. METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we first selected patients newly diagnosed with PUB in 2002-2009. Two groups comprising 13,732 COPD cases and 13,732 non-COPD matched controls were created using propensity score matching, thereby making the differences in basic demographics, medication use, and disease conditions between the two groups negligible. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the risk of recurrent PUB during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The cumulative recurrence rate of PUB was significantly higher in the patients with COPD than in the non-COPD matched controls (2years: 10.8% vs 9.3%; 6years: 18.3% vs 15.7%, P all <0.05), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.26, P<0.001) and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.12-1.26, P<0.001) within 2-year and 6-year follow-ups, respectively.

METHODS: The study included 159 no-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received gefitinib or erlotinib as maintenance treatment in the immediate group (85 patients) or as second-line therapy in the delayed group (74 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). EGFR mutation status was detected using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). RESULTS: PFS was 17.3 and 16.4 months in the immediate and delayed groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.69-1.42; P=0.947). In a subgroup analysis that included only patients with EGFR mutation, however, PFS was significantly longer in the immediate group than in the delayed group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27-0.85; P=0.012). In patients with wild type EGFR, the risk for disease progression was comparable between the two groups (HR, 1.23; 95% CI: 0.61-2.51; P=0.564).

Severe vitamin-D deficiency (serum 25[OH]D3 level < 5.0 ng/mL) was significantly related to increased mortality, even after adjusting for Child-Pugh and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. In particular, the presence of severe vitamin D deficiency clearly defined a subgroup with significantly poorer survival among patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5-10 or MELD scores \u2264 20. A new combination model of MELD score and severe vitamin D deficiency showed significantly more accurate predictive power for short- and long-term mortality than MELD scores alone. Additionally, serum 25(OH)D3 levels and new model scores were significantly associated with the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, overt encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSION: Serum 25(OH)D3 level is an independent prognostic factor for patients with liver cirrhosis and has a differential impact on disease outcomes according to MELD and Child-Pugh scores.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Most studies that report on salvage surgery after primary radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are small and heterogeneous. Subsequently, some relevant questions remain unanswered. We specifically focused on (1) difference in prognosis per tumor subsite, corrected for disease stage, and (2) differences in prognosis after salvage surgery for local, regional, and locoregional recurrences. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Single-center study (2000-2016). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with salvage surgery for HNSCC recurrence after (chemo)radiotherapy. RESULTS: In total, 189 patients were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 33%, and median OS was 18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 11-26) months. Treatment-related mortality was 2%. Larynx carcinoma was associated with more favorable local (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02; 95% CI, 1.46-11.10; P = .007) and locoregional control (adjusted HR = 5.34; 95% CI, 1.83-15.61; P = .002) than pharyngeal carcinoma. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (\u22653 vs 1-2: adjusted HR = 3.04; 95% CI, 1.17-7.91; P = .023), pT stage (3-4 vs 1-2: adjusted HR = 4.41; 95% CI, 1.65-11.82; P = .003), and salvage surgery for locoregional recurrences (locoregional vs local: adjusted HR = 3.81; 95% CI, 1.13-11.82; P = .021) were independent predictors for disease-free survival (DFS). CONCLUSION: Salvage surgery for larynx carcinoma, regardless of disease stage and other prognostic factors, results in more favorable loco(regional) control but not favorable DFS than pharyngeal carcinoma. The observed difference in DFS between salvage surgery for local and regional recurrences was not significant after correction for confounders. However, survival following salvage surgery for locoregional disease is significantly worse. For this subgroup, we propose to consider T status and comorbidity for clinical decision making, as high pT stage and ASA score are independent predictors for worse DFS.",

The prophylactic efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients and the HBVr risk in hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive patients during gestation were investigated. Eligible pregnant women were diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and were administered prednisone (\u226410\u2009mg daily) with permitted immunosuppressants at screening. HBsAg-positive participants were instructed to take TDF; those unwilling to take TDF were followed up as the control group. Propensity score matching was applied to control for differences in confounding factors between the HBcAb-positive and uninfected groups. Hepatopathy, maternal, pregnancy, and safety outcomes were documented as endpoints. A cohort of 1292 women was recruited from 2017 to 2020, including 58 HBsAg-positive patients (29 in each group). A total of 120 pairs in the HBcAb-positive and noninfection groups were analyzed. Among HBsAg-positive patients, 6 (20.7%) cases of hepatitis flare (hazard ratio [HR]: 7.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-36.89; p\u2009=\u00a00.014) and 12 (41.4%) cases of HBVr (HR: 8.71; 95% CI: 2.80-27.17; p\u2009<\u20090.001) occurred in the control group, while 0 occurred in the TDF prophylaxis group.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the methylation status of p15, DAPK, SOCS1 and FHIT genes in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) and to explore the prognostic significance of gene methylation. METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was used to detect the methylation of the above-mentioned 4 genes in 67 patients with MDS and 18 patients with iron-deficient anemia as controls. The gene methylation status of MDS patients and its effect on prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The methylation rates of p15, DAPK, SOCS1 and FHIT in 67 MDS patients were 37.3%, 35.8%, 47.8% and 52.2%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The methylation status of p15, SOCS1 was increased along with the increase of International Prognostic Scoring System(IPSS) scores (P<0.05), and \u22652 genes was more frequent in relatively high risk groups (P<0.05). The median overall survival time of patients with and without methylation were 15 and 21 months, respectively (P<0.05). Patients showing methylation of SOCS1 had a significantly shorter survival time in relatively low risk groups(P<0.05), meanwhile SOCS1, p15 and methylations of \u22652 genes had significantly shorter survival time in relatively high risk groups(P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, SOCS1 and p15 were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: p15, DAPK, SOCS1 and FHIT are higher hypermethylated genes in MDS. The methylations of SOCS1 and p15 are independent prognostic factor for overall survival in MDS.",

Then, the association of the position of the intracranial vascular stenosis and ABCD score with short-term prognosis was analyzed.Based on the ABCD score, the incidence of cerebral infarction after 1 week was significantly higher in the high-risk group (85.7%) than in the moderate-risk group (16.7%) and low-risk group (1.9%), and the differences were statistically significant (P\u200a<\u200a.05).

        "a": "PURPOSE: The PACS 01 trial compared six cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) with a sequential regimen of three cycles of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel (FEC-D) as adjuvant treatment for women with node-positive early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, 1,999 patients with operable node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to either FEC every 21 days for six cycles, or three cycles of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel, both given every 21 days. Hormone-receptor-positive patients received tamoxifen for 5 years after chemotherapy. The primary end point was 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 60 months. Five-year DFS rates were 73.2% with FEC and 78.4% with FEC-D (unadjusted P = .011; adjusted P = .012). Multivariate analysis adjusted for prognostic factors showed an 18% reduction in the relative risk of relapse with FEC-D. Five-year overall survival rates were 86.7% with FEC and 90.7% with FEC-D, demonstrating a 27% reduction in the relative risk of death (unadjusted P = .014; adjusted P = .017). The incidence of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, the need for hematopoietic growth factor, and incidence of nausea/vomiting were higher with FEC. Docetaxel was associated with more febrile neutropenia in the fourth cycle, stomatitis, edema, and nail disorders. Though rare overall, there were fewer cardiac events after FEC-D (P = .03), attributable mainly to the lower anthracycline cumulative dose. CONCLUSION: Sequential adjuvant chemotherapy with FEC followed by docetaxel significantly improves disease-free and overall survival in node-positive breast cancer patients and has a favorable safety profile.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: With the continuing increase in the use of definitive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with limited brain metastases (BM), clinicians need more specific prognostic tools. We investigated clinical predictors of outcomes in patients with limited breast cancer BM treated with SRS alone. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 136 patients with breast cancer and 1-3 BM who underwent definitive SRS for 186 BM between 2000 and 2012. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS), regional failure (RF), and local failure (LF). Associations between clinical factors and outcomes were tested using Cox regression. A point scoring system was used to stratify patients based on OS, and the predictive power was tested with concordance probability estimate (CPE). RESULTS: The median OS was 17.6 months. The 12-month RF and LF rates were 45% and 10%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, >1 lesion (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, P=.02), triple-negative (TN) disease (HR=2.0, P=.006), and active extracranial disease (ED) (HR=2.7, P<.0001) were significantly associated with worse OS. The point score system was defined using proportional simplification of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression function. The median OS for patients with 3.0-4.0 points (n=37), 4.5-5.5 points (n=28), 6.0-6.5 points (n=37), and 8-8.5 points (n=34) were 9.2, 15.6, 25.1, and 45.1 months, respectively (P<.0001, CPE = 0.72). Active ED (HR=2.4, P=.0007) was significantly associated with RF. Higher risk for LF was significantly associated with larger BM size (HR=3.1, P=.0001). CONCLUSION: Patients with >1 BM, active ED, and TN had the highest risk of death after SRS. Active ED is an important prognostic factor for OS and intracranial control.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Although levodopa/carbidopa intestinal infusion (LCIG) proved a sustained efficacy on Parkinson's disease (PD) motor fluctuations, there is a lack of studies on mortality of LCIG patients. In this study, we aimed at analyzing mortality and its predictors in a cohort of 105 PD patients treated with LCIG for over 10 years. METHODS: The death rate, death causes, mortality predictors, and serious adverse events (SAEs) were analyzed. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the influence of several demographic and clinical factors on mortality, and a binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between SAEs number and mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test was used for a survival comparison between patients with an early drop-out (within 3 years since LCIG start) and patients continuing LCIG. RESULTS: Ninety-eight advanced PD patients treated with LCIG were included. During follow-up, 34.7% of patients died at a mean age of 74.7 years, with a mean survival time of 4.6 years since LCIG start and 18 years since PD onset. The only predictor of mortality identified was the Mini Mental State Examination score at LCIG start (p:0.034). A total of 222 SAEs occurred in 87.9% of LCIG patients. The number of SAEs did not correlate with the mortality of LCIG patients (p:0.370). No survival difference exists between early drop-out patients and those continuing LCIG (p:0.341). CONCLUSION: Our findings do not indicate an association between SAEs or LCIG treatment duration and mortality and highlight the importance of cognitive alterations as a mortality predictor of LCIG patients.",

Composite of cardiac death and target segment myocardial infarction was the primary clinical endpoint. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2013 to December 2016, 1003 patients undergoing OCT evaluation of the untreated proximal left anterior descending coronary artery in the context of clinically indicated coronary angiogram were prospectively enrolled at 11 independent centres (clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT02883088). At 1-year, the primary clinical endpoint was observed in 37 patients (3.7%). In a total of 1776 lipid plaques, presence of MLA <3.5 mm2 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.0], FCT <75 \u00b5m (HR 4.7, 95% CI 2.4-9.0), lipid arc circumferential extension >180\u00b0 (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8), and OCT-defined macrophages (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.1) were all associated with increased risk of the primary endpoint. The pre-specified combination of plaque features (simultaneous presence of the four OCT criteria in the same plaque) was observed in 18.9% of patients experiencing the primary endpoint and was an independent predictor of events (HR 7.54, 95% CI 3.1-18.6).

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, mechanism, and potential protective strategies for pelvic fixation failure (PFF) within 2 years after adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. METHODS: Data for ASD patients (age \u2265 18 years, minimum of six instrumented levels) with pelvic fixation (S2-alar-iliac [S2AI] and/or iliac screws) with a minimum 2-year follow-up were consecutively collected (2015-2019). Patients with prior pelvic fixation were excluded. PFF was defined as any revision to pelvic screws, which may include broken rods across the lumbosacral junction requiring revision to pelvic screws, pseudarthrosis across the lumbosacral junction requiring revision to pelvic screws, a broken or loose pelvic screw, or sacral/iliac fracture. Patient information including demographic data and health history (age, sex, BMI, smoking status, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, osteoporosis), operative (total instrumented levels [TIL], three-column osteotomy [3CO], interbody fusion), screw (iliac, S2AI, length, diameter), rod (diameter, kickstand), rod pattern (number crossing lumbopelvic junction, lowest instrumented vertebra [LIV] of accessory rod[s], lateral connectors, dual-headed screws), and pre- and postradiographic (lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, major Cobb angle, lumbosacral fractional curve, C7 coronal vertical axis [CVA], T1 pelvic angle, C7 sagittal vertical axis) parameters was collected. All rods across the lumbosacral junction were cobalt-chrome. All iliac and S2AI screws were closed-headed tulips. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for PFF. RESULTS: Of 253 patients (mean age 58.9 years, mean TIL 13.6, 3CO 15.8%, L5-S1 interbody 74.7%, mean pelvic screw diameter/length 8.6/87 mm), the 2-year failure rate was 4.3% (n = 11). The mechanisms of failure included broken rods across the lumbosacral junction (n = 4), pseudarthrosis across the lumbosacral junction requiring revision to pelvic screws (n = 3), broken pelvic screw (n = 1), loose pelvic screw (n = 1), sacral/iliac fracture (n = 1), and painful/prominent pelvic screw (n = 1). A higher number of rods crossing the lumbopelvic junction (mean 3.8 no failure vs 2.9 failure, p = 0.009) and accessory rod LIV to S2/ilium (no failure 54.2% vs failure 18.2%, p = 0.003) were protective for failure. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that accessory rod LIV to S2/ilium versus S1 (OR 0.2, p = 0.004) and number of rods crossing the lumbar to pelvis (OR 0.15, p = 0.002) were protective, while worse postoperative CVA (OR 1.5, p = 0.028) was an independent risk factor for failure. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-year PFF rate was low relative to what is reported in the literature, despite patients undergoing long fusion constructs for ASD.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is used for both cardiovascular risk reclassification and as a gatekeeper for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The aims of this study were to assess to what extent CAC score results can reclassify the cardiovascular risk of patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on CCTA, and to measure the proportion of these patients whose primary prevention medication is changed after the exam. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of a multicenter registry of individuals who underwent CCTA for suspected CAD during a two-year period, the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) risk scores were calculated for each individual. In a subset of 184 patients, we also assessed the prescription of statins and antiplatelet agents before and after the test. RESULTS: A total of 467 patients (248 women, mean age 60\u00b19.10 years) were included. Median CAC score was 0 (interquartile range 0-40). Overall, 249 patients (53%) and 159 (34%) were classified as being of moderate/intermediate risk according to the SCORE and MESA risk scores, respectively. Among these, 29 (12%) and 30 (19%) patients had CAC score >100 AU, making them eligible for statin therapy. The inclusion of CAC scoring in the MESA score resulted in the reclassification of 215 patients (46%). The proportion of patients who were prescribed statins or antiplatelet agents did not change significantly after the test. CONCLUSION: CAC scoring can reclassify cardiovascular risk in a significant proportion of patients undergoing CCTA. Despite this, little change was seen in the prescription of statins and antiplatelet agents.",

        "a": "Background There are substantial opportunities to improve the quality of cardiovascular care in developing countries through the implementation of a quality program. Objective To evaluate the effect of a Best Practice in Cardiology (BPC) program on performance measures and patient outcomes related to heart failure, atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes in a subset of Brazilian public hospitals. Methods The Boas Pr\u00e1ticas em Cardiologia (BPC) program was adapted from the American Heart Association's (AHA) Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Program for use in Brazil. The program is being started simultaneously in three care domains (acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation and heart failure), which is an approach that has never been tested within the GWTG. There are six axes of interventions borrowed from knowledge translation literature that will address local barriers identified through structured interviews and regular audit and feedback meetings. The intervention is planned to include at least 10 hospitals and 1,500 patients per heart condition. The primary endpoint includes the rates of overall adherence to care measures recommended by the guidelines. Secondary endpoints include the effect of the program on length of stay, overall and specific mortality, readmission rates, quality of life, patients' health perception and patients' adherence to prescribed interventions. Results It is expected that participating hospitals will improve and sustain their overall adherence rates to evidence-based recommendations and patient outcomes. This is the first such cardiovascular quality improvement (QI) program in South America and will provide important information on how successful programs from developed countries like the United States can be adapted to meet the needs of countries with developing economies like Brazil. Also, a successful program will give valuable information for the development of QI programs in other developing countries. Conclusions This real-world study provides information for assessing and increasing adherence to cardiology guidelines in Brazil, as well as improvements in care processes.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis remain poor. We aimed to estimate the association of treatment success and death with the use of individual drugs, and the optimal number and duration of treatment with those drugs in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify potentially eligible observational and experimental studies published between Jan 1, 2009, and April 30, 2016. We also searched reference lists from all systematic reviews of treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis published since 2009. To be eligible, studies had to report original results, with end of treatment outcomes (treatment completion [success], failure, or relapse) in cohorts of at least 25 adults (aged >18 years). We used anonymised individual patient data from eligible studies, provided by study investigators, regarding clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Using propensity score-matched generalised mixed effects logistic, or linear regression, we calculated adjusted odds ratios and adjusted risk differences for success or death during treatment, for specific drugs currently used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, as well as the number of drugs used and treatment duration. FINDINGS: Of 12\u2008030 patients from 25 countries in 50 studies, 7346 (61%) had treatment success, 1017 (8%) had failure or relapse, and 1729 (14%) died. Compared with failure or relapse, treatment success was positively associated with the use of linezolid (adjusted risk difference 0\u00b715, 95% CI 0\u00b711 to 0\u00b718), levofloxacin (0\u00b715, 0\u00b713 to 0\u00b718), carbapenems (0\u00b714, 0\u00b706 to 0\u00b721), moxifloxacin (0\u00b711, 0\u00b708 to 0\u00b714), bedaquiline (0\u00b710, 0\u00b705 to 0\u00b714), and clofazimine (0\u00b706, 0\u00b701 to 0\u00b710). There was a significant association between reduced mortality and use of linezolid (-0\u00b720, -0\u00b723 to -0\u00b716), levofloxacin (-0\u00b706, -0\u00b709 to -0\u00b704), moxifloxacin (-0\u00b707, -0\u00b710 to -0\u00b704), or bedaquiline (-0\u00b714, -0\u00b719 to -0\u00b710). Compared with regimens without any injectable drug, amikacin provided modest benefits, but kanamycin and capreomycin were associated with worse outcomes. The remaining drugs were associated with slight or no improvements in outcomes. Treatment outcomes were significantly worse for most drugs if they were used despite in-vitro resistance. The optimal number of effective drugs seemed to be five in the initial phase, and four in the continuation phase. In these adjusted analyses, heterogeneity, based on a simulated I2 method, was high for approximately half the estimates for specific drugs, although relatively low for number of drugs and durations analyses. INTERPRETATION: Although inferences are limited by the observational nature of these data, treatment outcomes were significantly better with use of linezolid, later generation fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, clofazimine, and carbapenems for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These findings emphasise the need for trials to ascertain the optimal combination and duration of these drugs for treatment of this condition.

        "a": "PURPOSE: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to compare the difference in efficacy and safety between epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with antiangiogenic inhibitors (A + T) and EGFR-TKI monotherapy in patients with treatment-na\u00efve advanced EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched for relevant RCTs. Meeting abstracts were also reviewed to identify appropriate studies. The endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 1- and 2-year OS rates, objective response rate (ORR), and grade \u2265 3 adverse events. All pooled outcomes were expressed using hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: Data were collected from six eligible RCTs, which included 1,244 participants (619 in the A + T group and 625 in the TKI alone group). PFS was significantly improved with A + T compared to TKI alone (HR = 0.60; P < 0.01) regardless of EGFR mutation types (exon 19 deletion or L858R) and brain metastasis status (with or without brain metastases). There was no significant difference in median OS between the A + T and TKI alone groups (HR = 0.933; P = 0.551) regardless of EGFR mutation type. The ORR for A + T combination therapy was significantly increased compared to TKI monotherapy in exon 19 deletion subgroups (RR = 0.774; P = 0.008). There was no difference in the positive rates of acquired T790M mutation between the two groups (RR = 0.967; P = 0.846). More patients in the TKI alone group received a variety of subsequent systemic treatments than those in the A + T group (RR = 0.881; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Addition of antiangiogenic inhibitors to first-line EGFR-TKI therapy significantly reduced the risk of disease progression for patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC regardless of EGFR mutation type and brain metastasis status. The lack of OS benefit may be explained by differences in subsequent treatments rather than drug resistance mechanisms.",

METHODS: At 16 North Carolina hospitals, we enrolled a prospective, nonconsecutive sample of admitted patients with transient ischemic attack and with no stroke history, presenting within 24 hours of transient ischemic attack symptom onset. We conducted a medical record review to determine ischemic stroke outcomes within 7 days. According to a modified Rankin Scale Score, strokes were classified as disabling (>2) or nondisabling (< or =2). RESULTS: During a 35-month period, we enrolled 1,667 patients, of whom 373 (23%) received a diagnosis of an ischemic stroke within 7 days. Eighteen percent (69/373) of all strokes were disabling. We were unable to calculate an ABCD(2) score in 613 patients (37%); however, our imputed analysis indicated this did not significantly alter results. The discriminatory power of the ABCD(2) score was modest for ischemic stroke in 7 days (c statistic 0.59), and fair for disabling ischemic stroke within 7 days (c statistic 0.71). Patients characterized as low risk according to ABCD(2) score (< or =3) were at low risk for experiencing a disabling stroke within 7 days, with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.64) with missing values excluded and 0.34 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.76) when missing values were imputed. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests the best application of the ABCD(2) score may be to identify patients at low risk for an early disabling ischemic stroke. Further study of the ability to determine an ABCD(2) score in all patients is needed, along with validation in a large, consecutive population of patients with transient ischemic attack.",

        "a": "Purpose: This study was undertaken to characterise the virulence factors in clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and analyse their association with various infections caused and also to determine the association between virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance profile. Materials and Methods: A total number of 370 clinically significant, non-duplicate isolates of K. pneumoniae isolated from both hospitalised patients and patients attending clinics were included in this study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for the detection of various virulence genes such as mucoviscosity-associated gene A (magA), gene associated with allantoin metabolism (allS), Klebsiella ferric iron uptake(Kfu), capsule-associated gene A (K2A), regulator of mucoid phenotype A (rmpA), enterobactin (entB), yersiniabactin (YbtS), aerobactin, Fimbrial adhesin (FimH) and uridine-diphosphate galacturonate 4-epimerase (uge). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and PCR-based detection of beta-lactamase-encoding genes such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpCs and carbapenemases were performed. Univariate analysis was done to find the association between virulence genes and mortality. Results: The siderophore, entB, was present in most (90.5%) of the isolates. Of the 370 isolates, 345 carried multiple virulence genes; 15 harboured single virulence genes and 10 did not harbour any of the studied virulence genes. The most common combination of occurrence was entB and FimH. A mortality rate of 12.75% (38/298) was observed among hospitalised patients. None of the virulence genes had any significant association with mortality. Conclusion: Pathogenic K. pneumoniae can harbour single to multiple virulence genes. Invasive infection with even a single virulence gene-harbouring K. pneumoniae can lead to poor outcomes. Both multidrug-resistant (MDR) and non-MDR K. pneumoniae can harbour a variety of virulence genes. None of the virulence genes have a significant association with mortality.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To compare hemodynamics, time to extubation, and costs of target-controlled infusion (TCI) with manually controlled infusion (MCI) of propofol in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized. SETTING: Major community university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients undergoing first-time implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator with severely reduced left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%). INTERVENTIONS: Anesthesia was performed using remifentanil, 0.2 to 0.3 microg/kg/min, and propofol. Propofol was used as TCI (plasma target concentration, 2 to 3 microg x mL; n = 10) or MCI (2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg/hr; n = 10). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hemodynamics were measured at 6 data points: T1, before anesthesia; T2, after intubation; T3, after skin incision; T4, after first defibrillation; T5, after third defibrillation; and T6, after extubation. There were no significant hemodynamic differences between the 2 groups. Dobutamine was required to maintain cardiac index >2 L/min/m(2) in significantly more patients of the TCI group than of the MCI group. Mean dose of propofol was higher in the TCI patients (6.0 +/- 1.0 mg/kg/hr) than in the MCI patients (3.0 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/hr) (p < 0.05), whereas doses of remifentanil did not differ. Time to extubation was significantly shorter in the MCI (11.9 +/- 2.4 min) versus the TCI group (15.6 +/- 6.8 min). Costs were significantly lower in MCI patients (34.73 dollars) than in TCI patients (44.76 dollars). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severely reduced left ventricular function, TCI and MCI of propofol in combination with remifentanil showed similar hemodynamics. TCI patients needed inotropic support more often than MCI-treated patients. Although extubation time was longer in TCI patients and costs were higher, both anesthesia techniques can be recommended for early extubation after implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: An efficient approach to education and counseling before BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing is necessary for effective utilization of testing in the community. Education and counseling, when delivered individually, are limited by a shortage of trained health care providers as well as by financial and time constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretest education and counseling for breast cancer genetics in a group setting is equivalent to that provided on an individual basis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-two patients at high risk for harboring a BRCA mutation were randomly assigned to group or individual education and counseling sessions. Group education was followed by brief individual counseling. Knowledge and Impact of Events Scales (IES) were administered at baseline and after education and counseling and at 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months. Satisfaction with education and counseling was measured at completion of the session. Preferred method of education and counseling was solicited at 3 months. RESULTS: There was no difference in knowledge or IES scores between groups. When stratified by genetic test results, knowledge scores showed no difference. Regardless of group, post-test IES scores in patients with positive results were higher than patients with negative or uninformative results but returned to baseline by 12 months. Participants were equally satisfied with either method they were assigned. Significantly more time was spent per patient in individual sessions (1.25 hours) than in group education (0.74 hours). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that group education and counseling may confer similar benefits compared with traditional individual sessions. Additional investigation of this approach in larger numbers of patients is warranted.",

On tissue Doppler imaging, the E/E' ratio (ratio of transmitral Doppler early filling velocity to tissue Doppler early diastolic mitral annular velocity) was higher at the septal and lateral annulus in infants. Infant patients with KD are at increased risk for the development of coronary abnormalities and diastolic dysfunction.

        "t": "Noninferiority trials with nonadherence to the assigned randomized treatment.",
        "a": "BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to treatment assignment in a noninferiority randomized trial is especially problematic because it attenuates observed differences between the treatment arms, possibly leading one to conclude erroneously that a truly inferior experimental therapy is noninferior to a standard therapy (inflated type 1 error probability). The Lachin-Foulkes adjustment is an increase in the sample size to account for random nonadherence for the design of a superiority trial with a time-to-event outcome; it has not been explored in the noninferiority trial setting nor with nonrandom nonadherence. Noninferiority trials where patients have knowledge of a personal prognostic risk score may lead to nonrandom nonadherence, as patients with a relatively high risk may be more likely to not adhere to the random assignment to the (reduced) experimental therapy, and patients with a relatively low risk score may be more likely to not adhere to the random assignment to the (more aggressive) standard therapy. METHODS: We investigated via simulations the properties of the Lachin-Foulkes adjustment in the noninferiority setting. We considered nonrandom in addition to random nonadherence to the treatment assignment. For nonrandom nonadherence, we used the scenario where a risk score, potentially associated with the between-arm treatment difference, influences patients' nonadherence. A sensitivity analysis is proposed for addressing the nonrandom nonadherence for this scenario. The noninferiority TAILORx adjuvant breast cancer trial, where eligibility was based on a genomic risk score, is used as an example throughout. RESULTS: The Lachin-Foulkes adjustment to the sample size improves the operating characteristics of noninferiority trials with random nonadherence. However, to maintain type 1 error probability, it is critical to adjust the noninferiorty margin as well as the sample size. With nonrandom nonadherence that is associated with a prognostic risk score, the type 1 error probability of the Lachin-Foulkes adjustment can be inflated (e.g. doubled) when the nonadherence is larger in the experimental arm than the standard arm. The proposed sensitivity analysis lessens the inflation in this situation. CONCLUSION: The Lachin-Foulkes adjustment to the sample size and noninferiority margin is a useful simple technique for attenuating the effects of random nonadherence in the noninferiority setting. With nonrandom nonadherence associated with a risk score known to the patients, the type 1 error probability can be inflated in certain situations. A proposed sensitivity analysis for these situations can attenuate the inflation.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: This study aimed at determining the aggressiveness of chemotherapy (CT)in patients hospitalized in a supportive care unit (focusing on mortality, patient profiles, survival, readmissions, and CT near death). METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 247 consecutive patients were investigated at the admission (disease, treatments, oncologist's theoretical survival prognosis, internist's clinical global impression (CGI)). A 3-and 6-month follow-up was performed. Survival was assessed up to 3 years. RESULTS: Various cancer diagnoses were represented in polymorbid patients. Since disease onset, 69.6 % had received a first line of CT only; 147 patients (59.5 %) had CT at the admission; median CGI was 3 (range = 0-10); and theoretical survival prognosis was <12 months in 65.2 %. In-hospital mortality rate was 21 %. Odds of receiving CT was inversely associated with age (OR for patients \u2265 71 years vs. patients <50 years 0.19; 95 % CI 0.06-0.65; p = 0.02) and number of previous CT lines (OR for patients with 2-4 lines vs. those with 1 line 0.14; 95 % CI 0.06-0.34; p = 0.000). In the multi-adjusted model, 6-month survival remained associated with CT at the admission (HR 1.86; 95 % CI 1.31-2.65; p = 0.001), CGI (per point HR 0.84; 95 % CI 0.73-0.96; p = 0.013), and theoretical survival prognosis (per category HR 0.53; 95 % CI 0.44-0.66; p = 0.000). Very few patients needed readmission related to CT's adverse effects. From admission and throughout follow-up, 24 patients (9.7 %) had received CT during their last 14 days of life. CONCLUSION: This study showed that a supportive care program can benefit a heterogeneous population as it contributes to assess clinical risks and benefits of CT and prevent aggressive care near death.",

        "a": "The non-responders (NRs) after exercise training have been poorly studied in populations with morbid obesity. The purpose of this study was to determine the NR prevalence after 20\u00a0weeks of concurrent training of morbidly obese women with a high or low number of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. Twenty-eight women with morbid obesity participated in an exercise training intervention and were allocated into two groups distributed based on a high (\u22653, n = 11) or low number (<3, n = 17) of MetS risk factors. The main outcomes were waist circumference (WC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), high-density lipids (HDL-c), triglycerides (Tg), and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and secondary outcomes were body composition, anthropometric and physical fitness, determined before and after 20\u00a0weeks of concurrent training. NRs were defined as previously used technical error cut-off points for the MetS outcomes. Significantly different (all p < 0.05) prevalences of NRs between the H-MetS vs. L-MetS groups (respectively) in WC (NRs 18.2 % vs. 41.1 %, p < 0.0001), SBP (NRs 72.7 % vs. 47.0 %, p = 0.022), DBP (NRs 54.5 % vs. 76.4 %, p < 0.0001), FPG (NRs 100% vs. 64.8 %, p < 0.0001), and HDL-c (NRs 90.9 % vs. 64.7 %, p = 0.012) were observed. In addition, the H-MetS group evidenced significant changes on \u0394SBP (-10.2 \u00b1 11.4\u00a0mmHg), \u0394FPG (-5.8 \u00b1 8.2\u00a0mg/dl), \u0394HDL-c (+4.0 \u00b1 5.9\u00a0mg/dl), and \u0394Tg (-8.8 \u00b1 33.8\u00a0mg/dl), all p < 0.05. The L-MetS group only showed significant changes in \u0394WC (-3.8 \u00b1 5.0\u00a0cm, p = 0.009). Comparing H-MetS vs. L-MetS groups, significant differences were observed in \u2206FPG (-5.8 \u00b1 8.2 vs. +0.3 \u00b1 3.2\u00a0mg/dl, p = 0.027), but not in other MetS outcomes. In conclusion, 20\u00a0weeks of concurrent training promotes greater beneficial effects in morbidly obese patients with a high number of MetS risk factors. However, the NR prevalence for improving MetS outcomes was significantly superior in these more-diseased groups in SBP, FPG, and HDL-c, independent of their major training-induced effects.",

BACKGROUND: Ranolazine is an antianginal shown to reduce angina and improve exercise performance in selected patients with early-positive exercise testing and those with frequent angina. METHODS: We investigated the antianginal effects of ranolazine in the subgroup of patients with prior chronic angina (n = 3,565, 54%) enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) 36 trial of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Follow-up was a median of 350 days. RESULTS: Patients with prior angina received evidence-based therapy (95% aspirin, 78% statins, 89% beta-blockers, average 2.9 antianginal agents). The primary end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia) was less frequent with ranolazine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.97; p = 0.017), due entirely to a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.91; p = 0.002). Ranolazine also reduced worsening angina (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.00; p = 0.048) and intensification of antianginal therapy (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.92, p = 0.005). Exercise duration at 8 months was greater with ranolazine (514 s vs. 482 s, p = 0.002). Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction did not differ between treatment groups (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.16; p = 0.71). Symptomatic documented arrhythmias (2.9% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.92) and total mortality (6.2% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.96) were similar with ranolazine or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest study of ranolazine in patients with established coronary artery disease, ranolazine was effective in reducing angina with favorable safety in a substantially broader group of patients with angina than previously studied.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of H pylori eradication on dyspepsia symptoms and quality of life scores in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SIGLE, using appropriate subject headings and keywords, searching bibliographies of retrieved articles, and through contacts with experts in the fields of dyspepsia and with pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs to eradicate H pylori with placebo or other drugs known not to eradicate H pylori for patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected on individual and global dyspeptic symptom scores, quality of life measures and adverse effects. Dyspepsia outcomes were dichotomised into minimal/resolved versus same/worse symptoms. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve randomised controlled trials were included in the systematic review. Ten trials compared antisecretory dual or triple therapy with placebo antibiotics +/- antisecretory therapy, and evaluated dyspepsia at 3-12 months. Nine of these trials gave results as dichotomous outcomes evaluating 2,541 patients and there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies. There was a 9% relative risk reduction in the H pylori eradication group (95% CI = 4% to 14%) compared to placebo. The number needed to treat to cure one case of dyspepsia = 15 (95% CI = 10 to 31). A further two trials compared Bismuth based H pylori eradication with an alternative pharmacological agent. These trials were smaller and had a shorter follow-up but suggested H pylori eradication was more effective than either H2 receptor antagonists or sucralfate in treating non-ulcer dyspepsia. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: H pylori eradication therapy has a small but statistically significant effect in H pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia. An economic model suggests this modest benefit may still be cost-effective but more research is needed.",

        "a": "Hypertension affects approximately 26% of the world's adult population and is a recognized major risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. However, despite the availability of a range of effective antihypertensive agents and a growing awareness of the consequences of high blood pressure (BP), the treatment and control of hypertension remains suboptimal. A number of patient subgroups are categorized as 'high risk' and may have hypertension that is more difficult to treat, including obese individuals, patients with stage 2 hypertension, those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), patients with coronary artery disease or a history of stroke, and Black patients. As the benefits of lowering BP in patients with hypertension are unequivocal, particularly in high-risk patients, treating high-risk patients with hypertension to BP goals and maintaining 24-hour BP control is important to help reduce cardiovascular risk and improve outcomes. Although the BP goals recommended in current consensus guidelines for the management of patients with hypertension are based on cuff BP measurements, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) provides a valuable diagnostic tool and allows a more accurate assessment of BP levels throughout the 24-hour dosing period. ABPM is a better predictor of prognosis than office BP measurement and is also useful for assessing whether antihypertensive therapy remains effective in the critical last few hours of the dosing period, which usually coincides with the morning BP surge associated with arousal and arising. ABPM has been adopted by new evidence-based guidelines in the United Kingdom to confirm a suspected diagnosis of hypertension, which is an indication of the growing importance of ABPM in the management of hypertension. This review provides an overview of the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive therapy based on olmesartan medoxomil\u2009\u00b1\u2009hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil in high-risk patient populations enrolled in studies that reported ambulatory BP endpoints. The studies identified in this review showed that a titrate-to-BP goal strategy using olmesartan medoxomil- or amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil-based antihypertensive therapy was an effective and well-tolerated approach for maintaining BP control throughout the full 24-hour dosing period in high-risk patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Recently, the percentage of positive prostate biopsies has been reported to be statistically significant in predicting the biochemical outcome after either radical prostatectomy or 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the percentage of positive prostate biopsies in predicting the 5-year biochemical outcome for patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer undergoing permanent interstitial brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred sixty-two hormone naive patients underwent transperineal ultrasound-guided permanent prostate brachytherapy with generous periprostatic margins, using either 103Pd or 125I for clinical T1b/T2b NXM0 (1997 AJCC) adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland from April 1995 to October 1999. No patient was lost to follow-up. The actual percentage of positive biopsies (number of positive biopsies/total number of biopsies) was determinable for 255 of the 262 patients. Of the evaluated cases, 133 patients were implanted with 103Pd and 122 patients with 125I. The median patient age was 68 years (range 48-81). The median follow-up was 38.6 months (range 6-73). Follow-up was calculated from the day of implantation. Patients were stratified by the percentage of positive biopsies into the following groups: <34%, 34-50%, and >50%. Additional clinical parameters evaluated included patient age, clinical T-stage, Gleason score, pretreatment prostate specific antigen (PSA), risk group, and prostate volume. Low-risk patients were staged as clinical T1c/T2a, Gleason score < or =6, and pretreatment PSA < or =10 ng/mL, intermediate-risk patients presented with one unfavorable prognostic parameter, and high-risk patients presented with two or more unfavorable prognostic parameters (clinical stage T2b, PSA >10 ng/mL, Gleason score > or =7). Treatment parameters included the use of supplemental external beam radiation and choice of isotope. Biochemical disease-free survival was defined by the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology consensus definition. RESULTS: For the 255 evaluated patients, the 5-year actuarial biochemical no evidence of disease survival rate was 92.5%. For patients with low, intermediate, and high-risk disease, 95.8%, 98.1%, and 79.4% of patients were free of biochemical failure, respectively. When each risk group was stratified into the percent positive biopsy categories of <34%, 34-50%, and >50%, no statistical difference was found in biochemical outcome for the biopsy subgroups. In multivariate analysis, none of the clinical or treatment parameters predicted for failure in the low-risk group; only Gleason score was predictive for intermediate-risk patients and only PSA for high-risk patients. In the overall population, PSA and Gleason score were both found to be predictors of biochemical failure, but not risk group, clinical stage, or percentage of positive biopsies. There was no significant dependence between the percent positive biopsy group and the Kaplan-Meier biochemical survival rates for any of the various subgroups of clinical and treatment parameters, except for clinical stage T1c-T2a (p = 0.006). The median postimplant PSA was 0.2 ng/mL for patients with either low-risk disease or <34% positive biopsies and 0.1 ng/mL for all other risk groups or percent positive biopsy subgroups. CONCLUSION: Although a significant trend was found for biochemical failure with increasing percent positive biopsies in the overall population, our results suggest that the percentage of positive biopsies is not statistically significant in predicting the 5-year biochemical disease-free outcome for patients with low, intermediate, and high-risk disease undergoing permanent prostate brachytherapy. Only the Gleason score in intermediate-risk patients and the pretreatment PSA level in high-risk patients was predictive of biochemical failure. We believe this relative lack of significance for the percentage of positive biopsies is a result of dose escalation far exceeding other radiotherapy modalities and the ability to aggressively treat the periprostatic region compared with radical prostatectomy by way of the accurate placement of periprostatic seeds.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to devise and validate a practical prediction rule for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using easily available clinical and standard electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria. BACKGROUND: Reported prediction rules for postoperative AF have suffered from inconsistent results and controversy surrounding the added predictive value of a prolonged P-wave duration. METHODS: In 1,851 consecutive patients undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass, preoperative clinical characteristics and standard 12-lead ECG data were examined. Patients were continuously monitored for the occurrence of sustained postoperative AF while hospitalized. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of AF and to develop a prediction rule that was evaluated through jackknifing. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation occurred in 508 of 1,553 patients (33%). Multivariate analysis showed that greater age (odds ratio [OR] 1.1 per year [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.0 to 1.1], p < 0.0001), prior history of AF (OR 3.7 [95% CI 2.3 to 6.0], p < 0.0001), P-wave duration >110 ms (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1 to 1.7], p = 0.02), and postoperative low cardiac output (OR 3.0 [95% CI 1.7 to 5.2], p = 0.0001) were independently associated with AF risk. Using the prediction rule we defined three risk categories for AF: <60 points, 61 of 446 (14%); 60 to 79 points, 330 of 908 (36%); and >or=80 points, 117 of 199 (59%). The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve for the model was 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that post-CABG AF can be predicted with moderate accuracy using easily available patient characteristics and may prove useful in prognostic and risk stratification of patients after CABG. The presence of intraatrial conduction delay on ECG contributed least to the prediction model.",

The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with NAFLD in women with PCOS and evaluate noninvasive indices of hepatic fibrosis in patients with PCOS and NAFLD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with PCOS (n = 87) and women without PCOS (n = 40; controls) were included. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography after exclusion of alcohol consumption and viral or autoimmune liver disease. Anthropometric, clinical and metabolic variables, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, lipid accumulation product (LAP), FIB-4 index, NAFLD score, and transient elastography (TE; FibroScan) were obtained in subsets of patients with PCOS and NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients with PCOS were included (mean age: 34.4 \u00b1 5.7 years, mean body mass index [BMI]: 34.7 \u00b1 4.7 kg/m 2 ). NAFLD was present in 67 (77.0%) patients with PCOS versus 21 of 40 (52.5%) controls (p = 0.005). Women with PCOS and liver steatosis, compared with their NAFLD-free counterparts, had higher values of BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, along with higher frequencies of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. NAFLD was independently associated with waist circumference, serum triglycerides, and alanine aminotransferase levels. The FIB-4 index was not compatible with advanced fibrosis in any of the evaluated patients, while NAFLD score and TE were compatible with advanced liver fibrosis in 1 of 26 (3.8%) and 3 of 25 (12%) patients, respectively.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the predictive efficacy of prothrombin time (PT) with regarding for the severity and prognosis of septic patients, along with comparing with other routine coagulation parameters. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted. The clinical data of 302 septic patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1 to December 31 in 2019 were enrolled. Demographic and basic clinical data were collected. Laboratory data, including PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), D-dimer, fibrin (fibrinogen) degradation product (FDP), antithrombin (AT), platelet count (PLT) at ICU admission were recorded, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score within 24 hours of admission to ICU were also collected. What's more, some major clinical events, such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), etc. during ICU stay were also monitored. A follow-up 28 days observation of prognosis was performed. The patients were divided into the septic shock group and the non-septic shock group according to the occurrence of septic shock, and they were divided into the survival group and the non-survival group according to the 28-day prognosis. The differences in terms of above parameters between each two groups were compared. Spearman correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between routine coagulation parameters and SOFA score or APACHE II score. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was plotted to determine the predictive efficacy of each routine coagulation parameter with regarding to predict septic shock and 28-day mortality. Based on the cut-off value of PT, the septic patients were divided into two risk stratifications, and then the major clinical and end point outcome were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was applied to investigate the difference of the 28-day cumulated survival rate based on the different risk stratifications of PT level. Finally, multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to explore whether prolonged PT level was an independent risk factor for septic shock and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The 302 patients were all enrolled, including 120 patients with septic shock and 182 patients without. Seventy-five patients died within 28 days, while 227 survived. Comparing with the non-septic shock group or the survival group, the septic shock group or the non-survival group patients both had longer PT, APTT and TT, higher D-dimer, FDP and lower PLT, FIB and AT. Correlation analysis revealed that PT and PLT were better correlated with SOFA score (r values were 0.503 and -0.524, both P < 0.01), and PT was better correlated with APACHE II score (r = 0.407, P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that PT had the most powerful predictive efficacy for septic shock and 28-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 0.831 (0.783-0.879) and 0.739 (0.674-0.805), respectively. The cut-off value were 16.8 s and 16.3 s, respectively, with the sensitivity of 64.2%, 72.0% and the specificity of 89.0%, 70.9%, respectively. Risk stratification based on PT level revealed that the patients with PT > 16.5 s (n = 103) had higher rate of 28-day mortality, incidence of septic shock and DIC, and score of SOFA and APACHE II comparing to those with PT \u2264 16.5 s (n = 199). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the 28-day cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in the patients with PT > 16.5 s than those with PT \u2264 16.5 s (52.43% vs. 86.93%; Log-Rank test: \u03c72 = 49.428, P < 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed that PT > 16.5 s was an independent risk factor both for septic shock and 28-day mortality [model 1 (enrolled SOFA score): odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were 6.003 (3.040-11.855), 4.842 (2.114-11.089); model 2 (enrolled APACHE II score): OR and 95%CI were 7.675 (4.007-14.702), 5.160 (2.258-11.793)]. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other routine coagulation parameters, PT has the potential best predictive value for evaluating the severity of sepsis and the prognosis. When a patient is diagnosed with sepsis and has a result of PT longer than 16.5 s at ICU admission, the patient may have a higher risk of progression to septic shock and short-term death.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer (TC), accounting for more than 80% of all cases. Ferroptosis is a novel iron-dependent and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) reliant type of cell death which is distinct from the apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis. Considerable studies have demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in the biological process of various cancers. However, the role of ferroptosis in PTC remains unclear. This study aims at exploring the expression of ferroptosis-related genes (FRG) and their prognostic values in PTC. METHODS: A ferroptosis-related gene signature was constructed using lasso regression analysis through the PTC datasets of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the bioinformatics functions of significantly different genes (SDG) of ferroptosis. Additionally, the correlations of ferroptosis and immune cells were assessed through the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT database. Finally, SDG were test in clinical PTC specimens and normal thyroid tissues. RESULTS: LASSO regression model was utilized to establish a novel FRG signature with 10 genes (ANGPTL7, CDKN2A, DPP4, DRD4, ISCU, PGD, SRXN1, TF, TFRC, TXNRD1) to predicts the prognosis of PTC, and the patients were separated into high-risk and low-risk groups by the risk score. The high-risk group had poorer survival than the low-risk group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the signature's predictive capacity. Multivariate regression analysis identified the prognostic signature-based risk score was an independent prognostic indicator for PTC. The functional roles of the DEGs in the TGCA PTC cohort were explored using GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses. Immune related analysis demonstrated that the most types of immune cells and immunological function in the high-risk group were significant different with those in the low-risk group. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) verified the SDG have differences in expression between tumor tissue and normal thyroid tissue. In addition, cell experiments were conducted to observe the changes in cell morphology and expression of signature's genes with the influence of ferroptosis induced by sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: We identified differently expressed FRG that may involve in PTC. A ferroptosis-related gene signature has significant values in predicting the patients' prognoses and targeting ferroptosis may be an alternative for PTC's therapy.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Corneal and conjunctival injuries (CCI) comprise a large portion of the cases presenting to hospital-based emergency departments (ED) with ocular involvement. Urgent Care Centres (UCC) offer community based emergency care at lower cost than hospital-based emergency departments (ED) and with greater temporal convenience than primary care office settings. While CCI prevalence and treatment at hospital-based EDs has been well studied, this is the first report, to our knowledge, on CCI demographics and aetiology presenting to UCCs. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The setting is a UCC system in Israel, modelled on USA urgent care facilities, consisting of 17 branches at the time of the study. Electronic medical record data (between November 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016) of patients diagnosed with corneal disorder, foreign body or eye disorder were retrieved and reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data collected included gender, age, chief complaint, diagnosis, treatment and discharge status (sent home or referred to ED). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were assigned to each record based on a review of all fields. UCC results were compared to all ED patients in Israel using data from a public report. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 602\u00a0074 charts screened, 4797 patients presented with CCI (0.8%). The average age was 32.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0years and 71.3% were male. Among these, 26.4% were referred to the ED compared to 6.8% from the entire UCC cohort. ICD-9 code Foreign body (FB) of the eye was the most common cause of CCI (56.5%) followed by the following ICD-9 codes: trauma (18.1%), chemical in the eye (11.1%) and corneal disorder due to a contact lens (5.1%). Logistic regression analyses showed the following risk factors for ED referral: age (22-64), male gender, ICD-9 code FB, work-related injury and the presence of a clinical abrasion in the eye. CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology of ocular injury at UCC is similar to previous studies of ED. Most CCI can be treated at UCC saving ED resources and underscores the importance of this mode of health care delivery in the overall health system.",

The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence and characteristics of antibiotic use in Egyptian hospitals to identify opportunities for quality improvement. A point prevalence survey was conducted in 18 hospitals in March 2011. A total of 3408 patients were included and 59% received at least one antibiotic, with the most significant use among persons <12 years and intensive care unit patients (p < 0.05). Third generation cephalosporin were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics (28.7% of prescriptions). Reasons for antibiotic use included treatment of community-(27%) and healthcare-associated infections (11%) and surgical (39%) and medical (23%) prophylaxis. Among surgical prophylaxis recipients, only 28% of evaluable cases received the first dose within two hours before incision and only 25% of cases received surgical prophylaxis for <24 h. The prevalence of antibiotic use in Egyptian hospitals was high with obvious targets for antimicrobial stewardship activities including provision of antibiotic prescription guidelines and optimization of surgical and medical prophylaxis practices.",

        "a": "Mutations in several genes encoding ion channels can cause the long-QT (LQT) syndrome with cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and sudden death. Recently, mutations in some of these genes were also identified to cause epileptic seizures in these patients, and the sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) was considered to be the pathologic overlap between the two clinical conditions. For LQT-associated KCNQ1 mutations, only few investigations reported the coincidence of cardiac dysfunction and epileptic seizures. Clinical, electrophysiological and genetic characterization of a large pedigree (n = 241 family members) with LQT syndrome caused by a 12-base-pair duplication in exon 8 of the KCNQ1 gene duplicating four amino acids in the carboxyterminal KCNQ1 domain (KCNQ1dup12; p.R360_Q361dupQKQR, NM_000218.2, hg19). Electrophysiological recordings revealed no substantial KCNQ1-like currents. The mutation did not exhibit a dominant negative effect on wild-type KCNQ1 channel function. Most likely, the mutant protein was not functionally expressed and thus not incorporated into a heteromeric channel tetramer. Many LQT family members suffered from syncopes or developed sudden death, often after physical activity. Of 26 family members with LQT, seizures were present in 14 (LQTplus seizure trait). Molecular genetic analyses confirmed a causative role of the novel KCNQ1dup12 mutation for the LQT trait and revealed a strong link also with the LQTplus seizure trait. Genome-wide parametric multipoint linkage analyses identified a second strong genetic modifier locus for the LQTplus seizure trait in the chromosomal region 10p14. The linkage results suggest a two-locus inheritance model for the LQTplus seizure trait in which both the KCNQ1dup12 mutation and the 10p14 risk haplotype are necessary for the occurrence of LQT-associated seizures. The data strongly support emerging concepts that KCNQ1 mutations may increase the risk of epilepsy, but additional genetic modifiers are necessary for the clinical manifestation of epileptic seizures.",

        "a": "Background: Fluid therapy is a common intervention in critically ill patients. Fluid therapy errors may cause harm to patients. Thus, understanding of reported fluid therapy incidents is required in order to learn from them and develop protective measures, including utilizing expertise of pharmacists and technology to improve patient safety at the national level. Objectives: To describe fluid therapy incidents voluntarily reported in intensive care and high dependency units (ICUs) to a national incident reporting system, by investigating the error types, fluid products, consequences to patients and actions taken to alleviate them, and to identify at which phase of the medication process the incidents had occurred and had been detected. Methods: Medication related voluntarily reported incident (n = 7623) reports were obtained from all ICUs in 2007-2017. Incidents concerning fluid therapy (n = 2201) were selected. The retrospective analysis utilized categorized data and narrative descriptions of the incidents. The results were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Results: Most voluntarily reported incidents had occurred during the dispensing/preparing phase (n = 1306, 59%) of the medication process: a point of risk. Most incidents (n = 1975, 90%) had reached the patient and passed through many phases in the medication process and nursing shift change checks before detection. One third of the errors (n = 596, 30%) were reported to have caused consequences to patients. One quarter (n = 492, 25%) of the errors were reported to have required an additional procedure to alleviate or monitor the consequences. Conclusions: Utilizing national incident report data enabled identifying systemic points of risk in the medication process and learning to improve patient safety. To prevent similar incidents, initial interventions should focus on the dispensing/preparing phase before implementing active medication identification procedures at each phase of the medication process and nursing shift changes. Strengthening clinical pharmacy services, utilizing technology, coordinated by IV Fluid Coordinators and Medication Safety Officers, could improve patient safety in the ICUs.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c \u2264 69\u00a0mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein >88\u00a0mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia <1000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Survivors presented with complete normalization of their lipid profiles on short-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients referred for cardiac stress testing because of suspected cardiac disease completed the assessment of the demand for additional psychological treatment (ADAPT) questionnaire, an assessment tool for counselling demand in patients with chronic illness, the SF-36 quality of life and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) questionnaires. RESULTS: The questionnaires were administered to 233 patients (age: 54.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4, 57.5\u00a0% male). Exclusive\u00a0demand for disease-oriented counselling was indicated by 45.1\u00a0%, demand for psychotherapeutic counselling (exclusive or combined with disease-oriented demand) by 33.9\u00a0%. Almost all patients with psychotherapeutic demand\u00a0(96.3\u00a0%) expressed also request for disease-oriented\u00a0counselling. Patients with exclusive demand for disease-oriented\u00a0counselling showed\u00a0significantly lower scores in the emotional and physical functioning and role domains of the SF-36 than the norm population.\u00a0Patients demanding psychotherapeutic counselling reported significantly lower scores in all SF-36 domains than the norm population.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: This study analyzes factors associated with differences in long-term outcomes after hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer over time. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen-hundred consecutive patients undergoing hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer between 1985 and 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were grouped into 2 eras according to changes in availability of systemic chemotherapy: era I, 1985 to 1998; era II, 1999 to 2004. RESULTS: There were 1,037 patients in era I and 563 in era II. Operative mortality decreased from 2.5% in era I to 1% in era II (p = 0.04). There were no differences in age, Clinical Risk Score, or number of hepatic metastases between the 2 groups; however, more recently treated patients (era II) had more lymph node-positive primary tumors, shorter disease-free intervals, more extrahepatic disease, and smaller tumors. Median follow-up was 36 months for all patients and 63 months for survivors. Median and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) were better in era II (64 months and 51% versus 43 months and 37%, respectively; p < 0.001); but median and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) for all patients were not different (23 months and 33% era II versus 22 months and 27% era I; p = 0.16). There was no difference in RFS or DSS for high-risk (Clinical Risk Score >2, n = 506) patients in either era. There was a marked improvement in both RFS and DSS for low risk (Clinical Risk Score < or =2, n = 1,094) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite worse clinical and pathologic characteristics, survival but not recurrence rates after hepatic resection for colorectal metastases have improved over time and might be attributable to improvements in patient selection, operative management, and chemotherapy. The improvement in survival over time is largely accounted for by low-risk patients.",

DESIGN: A parallel group controlled repeated measures study. SETTING: Community pharmacies in Central West New South Wales. INTERVENTION: Standardised protocols and resources based on national asthma management guidelines, delivered by specially trained community pharmacists. Patients visited the pharmacy at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after baseline in the intervention group and at baseline plus 6 months after baseline in the control group. PARTICIPANTS: The intervention pharmacists (n = 12) were trained to deliver the RAMS model, while control pharmacists (n = 8) provided standard asthma care to their recruited patients. Fifty-one and 39 patients were recruited by intervention and control pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Asthma severity score which was a composite score based on recency, frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, and asthma history. RESULTS: Data compared at the final visit between groups indicated that the RAMS patient group demonstrated a significant reduction in the asthma severity scores (7.9 +/- 2.6 versus 10.4 +/- 2.6, P < 0.001); a reduction in the risk of non-adherence to medication scores (1.6 +/- 0.7 versus 2.3 +/- 1.1, P < 0.001); and an increase in the proportion of patients owning a written action plan (50% versus 23%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the community pharmacy-based RAMS model can improve asthma outcomes for patients in rural settings, and similar models for asthma and other chronic diseases should be tested rigorously and adopted in rural primary care practice.",

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the time course of recanalization and the risk of HT in patients with cardioembolic stroke studied within 6 hours of symptom onset. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with atrial fibrillation and nonlacunar stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory admitted within the first 6 hours after symptom onset were prospectively studied. Serial TCD examinations were performed on admission and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. CT was performed within 6 hours after stroke onset and again at 36 to 48 hours. RESULTS: Proximal and distal MCA occlusions were detected in 32 patients (60.4%) and 18 patients (34%), respectively. Early spontaneous recanalization occurring within 6 hours was identified in 10 patients (18.8%). Delayed recanalization (>6 hours) occurred in 28 patients (52.8%).

With a multiple logistic regression model, delayed recanalization (OR 8.9; 95% CI 2.1 to 33.3) emerged as independent predictor of HT. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed recanalization occurring >6 hours after acute cardioembolic stroke is an independent predictor of HT.",

Homozygous FH, presenting with clear clinical features, has a prevalence of\u2009~\u20091 per million. Prevalence of heterozygous FH is 1/500 European population. Atherosclerotic burden depends on the degree and duration of high LDL exposure. In severe cases, early detection is critical, and aggressive lipid-lowering therapies should begin in early childhood to reduce coronary heart disease risk. Pediatric therapeutic concepts correspond to adults and are orientated at LDL plasma concentration. Mean LDL plasma target value during treatment is\u2009<\u2009135\u00a0mg/dL. Medication in childhood consists of ezetemibe, statins, resins, and PCSK-9 inhibitors, with consideration for age restrictions. Only a minority achieve the treatment target with drug therapy alone. Therapeutic apheresis for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia selectively removes lipoproteins from blood (lipid apheresis (LA)). LA has a long tradition in adult medicine and is also safely used in children by a variety of methods, if customized to special pediatric needs. LA reduces cholesterol levels independently of residual LDL-receptor function and not only achieves reduction or disappearance of xanthomas but also inhibits progression of or mitigates aortic valve stenosis and supravalvular aortic stenosis as well as coronary artery and other atherosclerotic lesions. Cardiovascular prognosis of patients with otherwise untreatable FH depends largely on timely use of LA. Taking into account LA as a lifelong treatment, starting early in childhood, it is important to accommodate therapy modalities, such as treatment frequency and point of time, into the life of the individual.",

METHODS: We performed a systematic cohort study with two sets of cohorts to estimate the relative risks of outcomes among patients administered midazolam within 24 hours prior to delirium assessment. Propensity score matching was performed to generate a balanced 1:1 matched cohort and identify potential prognostic factors. The outcomes included the odds of delirium, mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospitalization, and odds of being discharged home. RESULTS: A total of 78,364 patients were included in this study, of whom 22,159 (28.28%) had positive records. Propensity matching successfully balanced covariates for 9348 patients (4674 per group). Compared with no administration of midazolam, midazolam administration was associated with a significantly higher risk of delirium, higher mortality, and a longer intensive care unit stay. Patients treated with midazolam were relatively less likely to be discharged home. There was no significant difference in hospitalization duration.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Specific comorbidities and old age create a greater vulnerability to severe Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the BMI and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 482 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportion Hazard models including demographic characteristics and comorbidities were carried out to predict the endpoints within 30 days from the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, P = 0.004) and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, P < 0.001). A significantly higher risk of death was observed in patients with a BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2 (OR: 12.1; 95% CI: 3.25-45.1, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a strong, independent risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the ICU and death among COVID-19 patients. A BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2 identifies a population of patients at high risk for severe illness, whereas a BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2 dramatically increases the risk of death.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) originally was developed to predict mortality within 1 year of hospital admission in patients without trauma. As it includes factors associated with medical and surgical complexities, it also may be useful as a predictive tool for hospital readmission after orthopaedic surgery, but to our knowledge, this has not been studied. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether an increased score on the CCI was associated with (1) readmission, (2) an increased risk of surgical site infection or other adverse events, (3) transfusion risk, or (4) mortality after orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: A total of 30,129 orthopaedic surgeries performed between 2008 and 2011 without any orthopaedic surgery in the preceding 30 days were analyzed. International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Revision codes were used to identify diagnoses, procedures, surgery-related adverse events, surgical site infection, and comorbidities as listed in the updated and reweighted CCI. A total of 913 patients (3.0%) were readmitted within 30 days after discharge; in 393 (1.4%) patients adverse events occurred; 417 patients (1.4%) had a surgical site infection develop; 211 (0.7%) needed transfusions, and 56 (0.2%) died within 30 days after surgery. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to determine whether the CCI was associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: The CCI accounted for 10% of the variation in readmissions. Every point increase in CCI score added an additional 0.45% risk in readmission for patients undergoing arthroplasty, 0.63% for patients undergoing trauma surgery, and 0.9% risk for patients undergoing spine surgery (all p < 0.01). The CCI was not associated with surgical site infection or other adverse events, but accounted for 8% of the variation in transfusion rate and 10% of the variation in mortality within 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The CCI can be used to estimate the risk of readmission after arthroplasty, hand and upper extremity surgery, spine surgery, and trauma surgery. It also can be used to estimate the risk of transfusion after arthroplasty, spine, trauma, and oncologic orthopaedic surgery and the risk of mortality after shoulder, trauma, and oncologic orthopaedic surgery.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: In aortic valve bypass (AVB) a valve-containing conduit is connecting the apex of the left ventricle to the descending aorta. Candidates are patients with symptomatic aortic valve stenosis rejected for conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). During the last one and a half year, 10 patients otherwise left for medical therapy have been offered this procedure. We present the Danish experiences with the AVB procedure with a focus on patient selection, operative procedure and short-term results. METHODS: AVB is performed through a left thoracotomy. A 19-mm Freestyle(\u00ae) valve (Medtronic) is anastomosed to a vascular graft and an apex conduit. The anastomosis to the descending aorta is made prior to connecting the conduit to the apex. In 1 patient, we used an automated coring and apical connector insertion device (Correx(\u00ae)). The device results in a simultaneous coring and insertion of an 18-mm left ventricle connector in the apical myocardium. AVB is routinely performed without circulatory assistance. RESULTS: Ten patients have been operated on since April 2011: eight females and 2 males with a median age of 76 (65-91) years. Seven patients had a severely calcified ascending aorta. Three of these had previously had a sternotomy, but did not have an AVR because of porcelain aorta. Six patients had a very small left ventricle outflow tract (<18 mm). The median additive EuroSCORE was 12 (10-15). Seven patients were operated on without circulatory assistance. Two patients had a re-exploration for bleeding and 1 developed a ventricle septum defect 1 month postoperatively and was treated with surgical closure. The median follow-up was 7 (2-15) months and was without mortality. New York Heart Association class was reduced from 2.5 to 2 at the follow-up, but some patients were still in the recovery period. The total valve area (native plus conduit) was 2.2 (1.9-2.5) cm(2) and 1.34 (1.03-1.46) cm(2)/m(2), indexed to the body surface area. There was no AV block or stroke. CONCLUSIONS: AVB can be performed with low mortality and acceptable results in selected patients. The procedure can be offered to patients rejected for conventional aortic valve replacement and TAVI and results in a larger total valve area than by insertion of standard bioprosthesis.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Current periodontal disease taxonomies have limited utility for predicting disease progression and tooth loss; in fact, tooth loss itself can undermine precise person-level periodontal disease classifications. To overcome this limitation, the current group recently introduced a novel patient stratification system using latent class analyses of clinical parameters, including patterns of missing teeth. This investigation sought to determine the clinical utility of the Periodontal Profile Classes and Tooth Profile Classes (PPC/TPC) taxonomy for risk assessment, specifically for predicting periodontal disease progression and incident tooth loss. METHODS: The analytic sample comprised 4,682 adult participants of two prospective cohort studies (Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and Piedmont Dental Study) with information on periodontal disease progression and incident tooth loss. The PPC/TPC taxonomy includes seven distinct PPCs (person-level disease pattern and severity) and seven TPCs (tooth-level disease). Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of these latent classes with disease progression and incident tooth loss, adjusting for examination center, race, sex, age, diabetes, and smoking. To obtain personalized outcome propensities, risk estimates associated with each participant's PPC and TPC were combined into person-level composite risk scores (Index of Periodontal Risk [IPR]). RESULTS: Individuals in two PPCs (PPC-G: Severe Disease and PPC-D: Tooth Loss) had the highest tooth loss risk (RR\u00a0=\u00a03.6; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.6 to 5.0 and RR\u00a0=\u00a03.8; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.9 to 5.1, respectively). PPC-G also had the highest risk for periodontitis progression (RR\u00a0=\u00a05.7; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.2 to 14.7). Personalized IPR scores were positively associated with both periodontitis progression and tooth loss. CONCLUSIONS: These findings, upon additional validation, suggest that the periodontal/tooth profile classes and the derived personalized propensity scores provide clinical periodontal definitions that reflect disease patterns in the population and offer a useful system for patient stratification that is predictive for disease progression and tooth loss.",

Our institution began performing MVR with modified, surgically placed, stented jugular vein grafts (Melody valve) in 2010. We sought to describe key echocardiographic features for pre- and postoperative assessment of this novel form of MVR. METHODS: The pre- and postoperative echocardiograms of 24 patients who underwent Melody MVR were reviewed. In addition to standard measurements, preoperative potential measurements of the mitral annulus were performed whereby dimensions were estimated for Melody sizing. A ratio of the narrowest subaortic region in systole to the actual mitral valve dimension (SubA:MV) was assessed for risk of postoperative left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). RESULTS: Melody MVR was performed at a median of 8.5\u00a0months (5.6\u00a0kg) for stenosis (5), regurgitation (3), and mixed disease (16). Preoperatively, actual mitral z scores measured hypoplastic (median -3.1 for the lateral [lat] dimension; -2.1 for the anteroposterior [AP] dimension). The potential measurements often had normal z scores with fair correlation with intraoperative Melody dilation (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.51 and 0.50 for lat and AP dimensions, respectively, both P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). A\u00a0preoperative SubA:MV <0.5 was associated with postoperative LVOTO, which occurred in 4 patients. Postoperatively, mitral gradients substantially improved, with low values relative to the effective orifice area of the Melody valve. No patients had significant regurgitation or perivalvar leak. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative echocardiographic measurements may help guide intraoperative sizing for Melody MVR and identify patients at risk for postoperative LVOTO. Acute postoperative hemodynamic results were favorable;\u00a0however, ongoing assessment is warranted.",

This report describes a cohort of 37 outpatients with severe MAC (>5 mm) of whom 32 were followed longitudinally with echocardiography (mean follow-up 2.6 + or - 1.6 years). Progression of the mitral valve gradient occurred in 16 of 32 (50%). There was wide variation in rate of progression with a few subjects demonstrating a rapid increase in gradient, up to 9 mm Hg/year. Progression of mitral valve gradient correlated with baseline gradient at rest and with severity of overall cardiac calcification as measured by a semiquantitative echocardiographic score. Age at index echocardiogram was inversely related to mitral valve gradient after baseline, suggesting that calcification may proceed at a greater rate in younger patients. In conclusion, although severe mitral stenosis is uncommon in patients with MAC, those with a pre-existing gradient at rest and severe overall cardiac calcification appear to be at greater risk for development of this disease state.",

Confirmation of IAFF should be supported by histopathological tests of intraoperative specimens which confirm infection, cultures from at least two suspected infection sites which reveal the same pathogen, a definite sinus or fistula which connects directly the bone or the implant, and purulent drainage from the wound or presence of pus during surgery. Diagnosis of IAFF is built on comprehensive assessment of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms of the patient, and imaging and laboratory tests. The gold standard of diagnosis is histopathological tests. Treatment of IAFF consists of radical debridement, adequate irrigation, implant handling, systematic and local antibiotics, reconstruction of osseous and/or soft tissue defects, and functional rehabilitation of an affected limb.

HLA-DQ2 is the major determinant of risk, but other minor genes, still to be identified, also are involved. METHODS: We designed a strategy that combines gene expression profiling of intestinal biopsy specimens, linkage region information, and different bioinformatics tools for the selection of potentially regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the disease. We selected 361 SNPs from 71 genes that fulfilled stringent functional (changes in expression level) and positional criteria (located in regions that have been linked to the disease, other than HLA). These polymorphisms were genotyped in 262 celiac patients and 214 controls.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age, and therefore many elderly patients presenting for cardiac surgery have atrial fibrillation. In recent publications, increasing age has been recognized as a predictor for ablation failure. Furthermore, many surgeons are reluctant to perform a surgical ablation in elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of concomitant surgical atrial fibrillation ablation in elderly patients. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2013, 556 patients underwent concomitant surgical atrial fibrillation ablation at the University Heart Center Hamburg and served as our primary study cohort. During follow-up, rhythm monitoring was established by 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram (70.5%) or an implantable loop recorder (29.5%) at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months postoperatively. The primary end point of the study was freedom from atrial fibrillation at 12\u00a0months follow-up and the detection of deviations from a linear association between age and risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence. A multiple logistic regression model including age as a linear term was used to identify predictors for rhythm outcome. RESULTS: Mean patients' age was 68.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.07\u00a0years, and 67.3% of the patients were male. Mean duration of atrial fibrillation was 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0years, and mean left atrium diameters were enlarged with 50.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0mm. There were no major ablation-related complications. The 30-day and 1-year survivals were 97.7% and 95.8%, respectively. The overall rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation ranged from 62% to 72% and was independent of age. The age-dependent risk of atrial fibrillation at 12\u00a0months was significantly increased in elderly patients undergoing a concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Multiple logistic regression model revealed double valve procedures (odds ratio, 3.48; P\u00a0=\u00a0.020), preoperative persistent atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.43; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in elderly patients (odds ratio, 2.03; P\u00a0=\u00a0.009) as risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm at discharge (odds ratio, 0.39; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and bipolar ablation (odds ratio, 0.32; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) were significant predictors for successful ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical atrial fibrillation ablation was safe and effective independently of age. Sinus rhythm at discharge and bipolar ablation were significant predictors for successful ablation, whereas double valve procedures, preoperative persistent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in elderly patients were risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation.",

A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Library from inception through April 2020. Human studies of all study types reporting results of FMT to treat chronic pouchitis were included. Nine studies, reporting FMT treatment of 69 patients with chronic pouchitis were found eligible for the review. Most studies were case series and cohort studies rated as having fair to poor quality due to high risk of bias and small sample size. Only one randomized controlled trial was included, finding no beneficial effect of FMT. In total clinical response after FMT was reported in 14 (31.8%) out of 44 evaluated patients at various timepoints after FMT, and clinical remission in ten (22.7%) patients. Only minor self-limiting adverse events were reported. FMT varied greatly regarding preparation, length of treatment, and route of delivery. The effects of FMT on symptoms of chronic pouchitis are not established, though some studies show promising results. Future controlled well-designed studies are warranted.",

        "a": "Since 2002, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has recommended a score system for tuberculosis diagnosis of children and adolescents that does not need bacteriological positivity, because most cases in this age group have few bacteria. An observational, transversal study was carried out at the outpatient health care service of the reference medical service in Salvador, Bahia, including 164 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, with ages ranging between 1 and 15 years of age, who were treated from 1990 to 2001. The gold standard used to establish the diagnosis was clinical, radiological, epidemiological and based on follow-up data. The score system for diagnosis purposes was tested retrospectively. The median age and the average age of the 164 patients were 6 and 6.62 years (SD +/- 4.33), respectively. About 65% of the sample reported a history of close contact with a tuberculous adult. The BCG vaccine coverage was 70.7% (116/164). It was found that 26% (43/164) of the patients had severe malnutrition. Out of this group, 26/43 (60.47%) were < 5 mm reactive to the tuberculin test. On the other hand, out of the 91 patients with tuberculin test < 5 mm, 29% (26/ 91) had severe malnutrition. The use of the score gave the following distribution: a) TB very likely in 81.7% (134/164) of the patients; b) possible TB in 15.9% (26/164) and TB unlikely in 2.4% (4/164). Among patients who had been vaccinated more than 2 years before, there was a 9 times higher risk of finding a tuberculin test above 10 mm in individuals with probable TB in comparison with the patients with possible or unlikely TB.",

        "a": "AIM: We undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between revascularization and outcomes after liver transplantation. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MeSH and key words. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Jadad Score and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the \u03c7(2) and I (2) tests. The risk of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test, and the risk of bias was assessed using a domain-based assessment tool. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by reanalyzing the data using different statistical approaches. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 467 patients were included. Ischemic-type biliary lesions were significantly reduced in the simultaneous revascularization group compared with the sequential revascularization group (OR = 4.97, 95%CI: 2.45-10.07; P < 0.00001), and intensive care unit (ICU) days were decreased (MD = 2.00, 95%CI: 0.55-3.45; P = 0.007) in the simultaneous revascularization group. Although warm ischemia time was prolonged in simultaneous revascularization group (MD = -25.84, 95%CI: -29.28-22.40; P < 0.00001), there were no significant differences in other outcomes between sequential and simultaneous revascularization groups. Assessment of the risk of bias showed that the methods of random sequence generation and blinding might have been a source of bias. The sensitivity analysis strengthened the reliability of the results of this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that simultaneous revascularization in liver transplantation may reduce the incidence of ischemic-type biliary lesions and length of stay of patients in the ICU.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a therapeutic alternative to surgery for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in high-surgical risk patients. The aim of this study was to compare 30-day mortality of high-risk patients treated by TAVI versus surgical aortic valve replacement. METHODS: A total of 175 patients (60 men; mean age, 80\u00b16 years; Euroscore 21\u00b113%) having undergone TAVI were compared with 175 matched patients (76 men; mean age, 79\u00b13 years; Euroscore 17\u00b19%), which have undergone conventional aortic valve replacement and were deemed to be high-risk patients by the cardiothoracic surgeons. Thirty-day mortality and major adverse events were recorded in both groups. Patients' characteristics were analyzed for predictors of mortality in the TAVI group. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (12%) in the TAVI group and 13 patients (8%) in the surgical group died within 30 days of the procedure (P=0.165). Two patients (1%) in the TAVI group and one patient (0.5%) in the conventional surgery group had a major stroke (P=1.0). Seven patients (4%) in the TAVI group and 25 patients (14%) in the conventional surgery group required dialysis post procedure (P=0.0013). The average length of stay in the intensive care unit was lower in the TAVI group compared with the conventional surgical group (3.3\u00b13.1 vs. 6.6\u00b110.5 days; P<0.001). Age was the only independent predictor of mortality in the TAVI group (odds ratio=1.009; 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.018 per additional year; P=0.0186) and in the total study population (odds ratio=1.007; 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.013 per additional year; P=0.0186). CONCLUSION: In high-surgical risk patients, TAVI can be performed at a mortality risk comparable with conventional surgery with a reduced length of post interventional intensive care unit stay and less need for dialysis.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment of patients with acute type B dissections continues to be debated. METHODS: A 36-year clinical experience of medical and surgical treatments in 189 patients was retrospectively analyzed (multivariable Cox proportional hazards model) with respect to three outcome end points: all deaths, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from late aortic complications or death. Propensity score analysis identified 2 quintiles (quintiles I and II, consisting of 142 comparable patients) for further comparison of the effects of surgical versus medical treatment. RESULTS: Shock (hazard ratio 14.5, 95% confidence interval 4.7-44.5, P <.001) and visceral ischemia (hazard ratio 10.9, 95% confidence interval 3.9-30.3, P <.001) largely predominated as determinants of death, along with 6 other risk factors (arch involvement, rupture, stroke, previous sternotomy, and coronary or lung disease), which roughly doubled the hazard of death. Female sex was a significant but weaker predictor of death. Renal dysfunction, year of presentation, age, and mode of therapy (medical vs surgical) had no important bearing on overall survival. The actuarial survival estimates for all patients were 71%, 60%, 35%, and 17% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, and were similar for the medical and surgical patients. Reoperation and late aortic complications were predicted by the presence of Marfan syndrome. For the propensity-matched patients in quintiles I and II, survival, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from aortic complications were almost identical in the medically treated and surgical subsets. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with acute type B aortic dissection is bleak and determined primarily by dissection-related and patient-specific risk factors, which do not appear to be readily modifiable.",

        "a": "Obesity is associated with risk of colorectal adenoma (CRA) and colorectal cancer. The signaling pathway activated by metformin (LKB1/AMPK/mTOR) is implicated in tumor suppression in ApcMin/+ mice via metformin-induced reduction in polyp burden, increased ratio of pAMPK/AMPK, decreased pmTOR/mTOR ratio, and decreased pS6Ser235/S6Ser235 ratio in polyps. We hypothesized that metformin would affect colorectal tissue S6Ser235 among obese patients with recent history of CRA. A phase IIa clinical biomarker trial was conducted via the U.S. National Cancer Institute-Chemoprevention Consortium. Nondiabetic, obese subjects (BMI \u226530) ages 35 to 80 with recent history of CRA were included. Subjects received 12 weeks of oral metformin 1,000 mg twice every day. Rectal mucosa biopsies were obtained at baseline and end-of-treatment (EOT) endoscopy. Tissue S6Ser235 and Ki-67 immunostaining were analyzed in a blinded fashion using Histo score (Hscore) analysis. Among 32 eligible subjects, the mean baseline BMI was 34.9. Comparing EOT to baseline tissue S6Ser235 by IHC, no significant differences were observed. Mean (SD) Hscore at baseline was 1.1 (0.57) and 1.1 (0.51) at EOT; median Hscore change was 0.034 (P = 0.77). Similarly, Ki-67 levels were unaffected by the intervention. The adverse events were consistent with metformin's known side-effect profile. Among obese patients with CRA, 12 weeks of oral metformin does not reduce rectal mucosa pS6 or Ki-67 levels. Further research is needed to determine what effects metformin has on the target tissue of origin as metformin continues to be pursued as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.",

Administrative linkage health data have become more accessible and can be used to monitor and reduce HAC. AIMS: This study aims to use linkage administrative data to benchmark the safety performance of hospitals and estimate the feasible magnitude that HAC can be reduced. We also identify risk factors associated with HACs, and estimate the effects of HACs on adverse health outcomes and hospital costs. METHODS: This is a retrospective linkage cohort study. The cohort includes 371,040 inpatient multiple-day admissions of 83,025 cardiovascular disease patients admitted to public hospitals in 2010 with follow-ups until 2015.Data envelopment analysis was applied to benchmark the patient safety performance of hospitals. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of HAC and its effects on in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission. Generalised linear models were used to identify the impacts of HACs on hospital costs and the length of hospital stay. FINDINGS: On average, 9.3% of multiple-day hospital admissions were associated with HACs. The average HAC rate can be reduced by two percentage points if all hospitals achieve the safety record of best-practice hospitals. Old age and multiple comorbidities were major driving factors of HACs. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease patients with HAC have a higher risk of death, stay longer in hospitals and incur higher health care costs. The average HAC rates can be reduced by two percentage points by learning from best-practice hospitals operating in the same region.",

Our study, performed in Spanish pediatric IBD patients at diagnosis onset, shows that low BMD already existed at the beginning of the disease. Low weight and height are also associated with low BMD and have to be considered as risk factors. INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported to be associated, even at disease onset, with low bone mass. The aim of this study was to know the bone mineral density (BMD) status in the IBD pediatric population of group of Spanish children, at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients' records from pediatric IBD patients diagnosed in our unit in the last 10\u00a0years. BMD was measured at the time of diagnosis and was expressed by Z-score. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included. Sixty-one percent were male and 47.4% had Crohn's disease (CD). Average age was 11.18 (SD 2.24) years old. Median BMD Z-score was\u2009-\u20090.30 (interquartile range:\u2009-\u20091.10 to\u2009+\u20090.10). Low BMD, defined as Z-score\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2009-\u20092SD, was present in 5% of patients, but there was no single patient with osteoporosis. There were no differences in BMD between Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and CD. Statistical differences appeared between healthy Spanish pediatric population and our IBD cohort, these having lower BMD for the same age and gender. A linear regression analysis showed a significant association between BMD Z-score and patient\u00b4s weight and height Z-score with a p values of 0.001 and 0.048, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal bone density is present at diagnosis in Spanish pediatric patients with IBD. There is no difference in BMD between patients with CD and UC. Lower weight and height are associated with a lower BMD; thus these data at IBD diagnosis should be considered as a risk factor for bone disease in the pediatric population.",

In patients with structural heart disease and elevated cardiovascular risk, flecainide is believed to be harmful. Therefore, data about safety and effectiveness of single-dose flecainide for cardioversion in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk are lacking. OBJECTIVES: One-hundred and six consecutive patients with recent onset AF and known structural heart disease and/or elevated PROCAM-score did receive oral flecainide 300 mg for cardioversion. METHODS: The effectiveness, safety and influencing factors of flecainide for cardioversion in high-risk patients were prospectively assessed. RESULTS: In 43 of 106 patients (40.6%), sinus rhythm could be restored within 192.4 +/- 10.7 min by flecainide. The PROCAM-score was 41.5 +/- 0.56 in patients with successful cardioversion compared to 45.7 +/- 0.74 in patients without successful cardioversion (P < 0.001). ACE-inhibitor co-medication was associated with a significantly lower rate of conversion by flecainide (HR 2.3, 95% CI, 1.12-4.26, P < 0.01). In 58 of 63 patients in whom cardioversion by flecainide was not effective, electrical cardioversion was performed which was successful in 47 patients. Life-threatening arrhythmias did not occur in any patient. The most common side effect was sinus-bradycardia and transient sinus arrest (2-4 s) immediately after conversion. CONCLUSIONS: When monitored properly, flecainide is safe and useful for cardioversion in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk.",

The purpose of this study was to develop a high-dimensional, patient-specific risk-stratification nomogram that allows dynamic risk modification based on operative decisions. METHODS: We evaluated 16,696 primary nononcologic THAs performed between 1998 and 2018. During a mean 6-year follow-up, 558 patients (3.3%) sustained a PPFFx. Patients were characterized by individual natural language processing-assisted chart review on nonmodifiable factors (demographics, THA indication, and comorbidities), and modifiable operative decisions (femoral fixation [cemented/uncemented], surgical approach [direct anterior, lateral, and posterior], and implant type [collared/collarless]). Multivariable Cox regression models and nomograms were developed with PPFFx as a binary outcome at 90 days, 1 year, and 5 years, postoperatively. RESULTS: Patient-specific PPFFx risk based on comorbid profile was wide-ranging from 0.4-18% at 90 days, 0.4%-20% at 1 year, and 0.5%-25% at 5 years. Among 18 evaluated patient factors, 7 were retained in multivariable analyses. The 4 significant nonmodifiable factors included the following: women (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0= 1.6), older age (HR\u00a0= 1.2 per 10 years), diagnosis of osteoporosis or use of osteoporosis medications (HR\u00a0= 1.7), and indication for surgery other than osteoarthritis (HR\u00a0= 2.2 for fracture, HR\u00a0= 1.8 for inflammatory arthritis, HR\u00a0= 1.7 for osteonecrosis). The 3 modifiable surgical factors were included as follows: uncemented femoral fixation (HR\u00a0= 2.5), collarless femoral implants (HR\u00a0= 1.3), and surgical approach other than direct anterior (lateral HR\u00a0= 2.9, posterior HR\u00a0= 1.9).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: This study compared 1-year risk of psychiatric hospitalization and treatment costs in commercially insured patients with bipolar disorder, treated with aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone. METHODS: This was a retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study using the Ingenix Lab/Rx integrated insurance claims dataset. Patients with bipolar disorder and 180 days of pre-index enrollment without antipsychotic exposure who received atypical antipsychotic agents were followed for up to 12 months following the initial antipsychotic prescription. The primary analysis used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate time-dependent risk of hospitalization, adjusting for age, sex and pre-index hospitalization. Generalized gamma regression compared post-index costs between treatment groups. RESULTS: Compared to aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine and quetiapine had higher risks for hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.96, 1.55 and 1.56, respectively; p < 0.05); risperidone had a numerically higher but not statistically different risk (hazard ratio 1.37; p = 0.10). Mental health treatment costs were significantly lower for aripiprazole compared with ziprasidone (p = 0.004) and quetiapine (p = 0.007), but not compared to olanzapine (p = 0.29) or risperidone (p = 0.80). Total healthcare costs were significantly lower for aripiprazole compared to quetiapine (p = 0.040) but not other comparators. CONCLUSIONS: In commercially insured adults with bipolar disorder followed for 1 year after initiation of atypical antipsychotics, treatment with aripiprazole was associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalization than ziprasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone, although this did not reach significance with the latter. Aripiprazole was also associated with significantly lower total healthcare costs than quetiapine, but not the other comparators.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational study of 111 women who underwent cervical ripening with two Propess\u00ae during the study period from 1st July 2007 to 31st October 2011. Modes of delivery, success of cervical ripening, failure of labor induction, maternal and neonatal morbidity were reported. RESULTS: The nulliparous rate was 75,7%. The main indications for induction of labor were post-term pregnancy in 34,3% (38/111) and premature rupture of membranes in 25,2% (28/111). The rate of vaginal delivery was 53,1% (59/111). Cesarean sections were performed for failure of labor induction in 27/52 (51,9%) and an abnormal fetal heart rate in 17/52 (32.7%).

Systemic inflammatory markers, particularly the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), are related to the survival of patients with CAM. The present retrospective analysis based on a prospective multicenter cohort study, which involved 1,437 hospitalized patients with CAM. METHODS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ten inflammatory indicators-LCR, advanced lung cancer inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index, modified Glasgow prognostic score, systemic immune-inflammation index, albumin-to-globulin ratio, LCR score, glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio-were constructed. Nutritional status, blood markers, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated within 48 h of admission. The overall survival (OS) was evaluated from September 1 to December 29, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 1,431 cancer patients diagnosed with malnutrition based on the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Male patients were 62.8% of all, and the mean age was 60.66 years old. The AUC of LCR was higher than that of other inflammatory markers. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) of the Hazard ratios (HRs) showed an inverse L-shaped relationship with LCR. In addition, patients with low LCR had significantly poorer OS than those with high LCR. The addition of LCR to the model increased the predictive ability of 1-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.036), 3-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.038), and 5-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the LCR can help the medical staff identify cancer patients with nutritional deficiency at high risk of oncological outcomes and develop individualized therapeutic strategies.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Plain radiography (XR) series are standard of care for detection of fall-related fractures in older patients with low-energy falls (LEF) in the emergency department (ED). We have investigated the prevalence of fractures and diagnostic accuracy of XR imaging in the ED. METHODS: 2839 patients with LEF, who were presented to two urban level I trauma centers in 2016 and received XR and computed tomography (CT), were consecutively included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of fractures of the vertebral column, rib cage, pelvic ring, and proximal long bones. Secondary endpoints were diagnostic accuracy of XR for fracture detection with CT as reference standard and cumulative radiation doses applied. RESULTS: Median age was 82 years (range 65-105) with 64.1% female patients. Results revealed that 585/2839 (20.6%) patients sustained fractures and 452/2839 (15.9%) patients received subsequent XR and CT examinations of single body regions. Cross-tabulation analysis revealed sensitivity of XR of 49.7%, a positive likelihood ratio of 27.6, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: XR is of moderate diagnostic accuracy for ruling-out fractures of the spine, pelvic ring, and rib cage in older patients with LEF. Prospective validations are required to investigate the overall risk-benefit of direct CT imaging strategies, considering the trade-off between diagnostic safety, health care costs, and radiation exposure.",

        "a": "Practice guidelines recommend outpatient care for selected patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism (PE), but fail to specify how these low-risk patients should be identified. Using data from U.S. patients, we previously derived the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), a prediction rule that risk stratifies patients with PE. We sought to validate the PESI in a European patient cohort. We prospectively validated the PESI in patients with PE diagnosed at six emergency departments in three European countries. We used baseline data for the rule's 11 prognostic variables to stratify patients into five risk classes (I-V) of increasing probability of mortality. The outcome was overall mortality at 90 days after presentation. To assess the accuracy of the PESI to predict mortality, we estimated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for low- (risk classes I/II) versus higher-risk patients (risk classes III-V), and the discriminatory power using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among 357 patients with PE, overall mortality was 5.9%, ranging from 0% in class I to 17.9% in class V. The 186 (52%) low-risk patients had an overall mortality of 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1-3.8%) compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 6.8-16.8%) in the 171 (48%) higher-risk patients. The PESI had a high sensitivity (91%, 95% CI: 71-97%) and a negative predictive value (99%, 95% CI: 96-100%) for predicting mortality. The area under the ROC curve was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.86). The PESI reliably identifies patients with PE who are at low risk of death and who are potential candidates for outpatient care. The PESI may help physicians make more rational decisions about hospitalization for patients with PE.",

        "a": "CONTEXT: There is little level 1 evidence regarding the relative efficacy of radical prostatectomy (RP) compared with radiotherapy (RT) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for high-risk prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality (OM and PCM) among patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with RP or RT/ADT. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through July 2019 covering a period since 2009. We report the results of our systematic search according to recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were extracted for each endpoint. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 23 studies with low to moderate risk of bias were found to meet the inclusion criteria. In keeping with prior studies, external beam radiation therapy (XRT) without specification of ADT was associated with worse OM and PCM (aHR 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-1.91, p\u2009<\u2009 0.0001: I2\u2009=\u200953.4%) and (aHR 1.90, 95% CI 1.61-2.23, p\u2009<\u2009 0.0001: I2\u2009=\u200950.4%). These associations were weaker although not entirely eliminated when comparing RT/ADT versus RP (PCM aHR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16-2.04, p\u2009=\u2009 0.002: I2\u2009=\u200961.5%). Combination of RT and brachytherapy (MaxRT), on the contrary, was associated with improved PCM compared with RP (aHR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.78, p\u2009=\u2009 0.003: I2\u2009=\u200923.8%), an effect that was not significant when comparing MaxRT with the combination RP/adjuvant RT (aHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59-1.11, p\u2009=\u2009 0.197: I2\u2009=\u20090%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence demonstrating definitive superiority of either modality is lacking. Recent studies show improved consideration of ADT, radiation dose, brachytherapy boost, and utilization of postoperative adjuvant radiation. Residual confounding continues to limit the interpretation of observational data. PATIENT SUMMARY: In the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer, many observational studies reporting higher mortality for radiotherapy demonstrate potential for confounding. More recent studies with current standard of care radiation regimens using androgen deprivation therapy or brachytherapy boost demonstrate approaching equivalence of prostatectomy and radiation modalities. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

        "a": "Importance: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality. Interferon (IFN) \u03b2-1a may prevent the underlying event of vascular leakage. Objective: To determine the efficacy and adverse events of IFN-\u03b2-1a in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted at 74 intensive care units in 8 European countries (December 2015-December 2017) that included 301 adults with moderate to severe ARDS according to the Berlin definition. The radiological and partial pressure of oxygen, arterial (Pao2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) criteria for ARDS had to be met within a 24-hour period, and the administration of the first dose of the study drug had to occur within 48 hours of the diagnosis of ARDS. The last patient visit was on March 6, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of 10 \u03bcg of IFN-\u03b2-1a (144 patients) or placebo (152 patients) once daily for 6 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a score combining death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (score ranged from -1 for death to 27 if the patient was off ventilator on the first day). There were 16 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality, which were tested hierarchically to control type I error. Results: Among 301 patients who were randomized (mean age, 58 years; 103 women [34.2%]), 296 (98.3%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis. At 28 days, the median composite score of death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 10 days (interquartile range, -1 to 20) in the IFN-\u03b2-1a group and 8.5 days (interquartile range, 0 to 20) in the placebo group (P\u2009=\u2009.82). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the IFN-\u03b2-1a vs placebo groups (26.4% vs 23.0%; difference, 3.4% [95% CI, -8.1% to 14.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.53). Seventy-four patients (25.0%) experienced adverse events considered to be related to treatment during the study (41 patients [28.5%] in the IFN-\u03b2-1a group and 33 [21.7%] in the placebo group). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with moderate or severe ARDS, intravenous IFN-\u03b2-1a administered for 6 days, compared with placebo, resulted in no significant difference in a composite score that included death and number of ventilator-free days over 28 days.

        "a": "Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) is an early and frequent symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Likewise, affective symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) and alterations in the processing of emotional stimuli have been frequently reported. Thus, abilities that integrate affective and cognitive processes such as decision making (DM) based on affective feedback are potentially valuable early diagnostic markers for MS. The available research on this topic, however, is still inconclusive and suffers from methodological issues. Methods: We compared DM ability in a clinically homogeneous cohort of 24 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 59 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). A modified version of the Iowa gambling task (IGT) allowed us to control for individual differences in search strategies during the risk exploration phase. Besides standard IGT measures (netscore, obtained play money, and learning index), we also examined reaction times and post-error slowing (PES) patterns as a proxy for abnormalities in the processing of affective feedback. Results: The performance of patients did not significantly deviate from HCs in any standard parameter of the modified IGT. Furthermore, although RRMS patients reacted significantly slower than HCs overall, we found similar patterns of PES in both groups, suggesting similarly efficient processing of affective feedback. Conclusion: We conclude that there is no specific deficit in affective feedback processing in early RRMS. Previous findings of IGT impairments in this patient group may thus not represent a genuine deficit in affective DM but rather be related to sample characteristics, general CI, and/or differences in individual search strategies. Future research should explore the potential influence of lesion volumes and locations on DM ability by employing brain imaging techniques.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: In many randomized controlled trials, patients and doctors are more interested in the per-protocol effect than in the intention-to-treat effect. However, valid estimation of the per-protocol effect generally requires adjustment for prognostic factors associated with adherence. These adherence adjustments have been strongly questioned in the clinical trials community, especially after 1980 when the Coronary Drug Project team found that adherers to placebo had lower 5-year mortality than non-adherers to placebo. METHODS: We replicated the original Coronary Drug Project findings from 1980 and re-analyzed the Coronary Drug Project data using technical and conceptual developments that have become established since 1980. Specifically, we used logistic models for binary outcomes, decoupled the definition of adherence from loss to follow-up, and adjusted for pre-randomization covariates via standardization and for post-randomization covariates via inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: The original Coronary Drug Project analysis reported a difference in 5-year mortality between adherers and non-adherers in the placebo arm of 9.4\u2009percentage points. Using modern approaches, we found that this difference was reduced to 2.5 (95% confidence interval: -2.1 to 7.0). CONCLUSION: Valid estimation of per-protocol effects may be possible in randomized clinical trials when analysts use appropriate methods to adjust for post-randomization variables.",

        "a": "Despite a significant decrease of surgery-related mortality and morbidity, anastomotic leakage still occurs in a significant number of patients after esophagectomy. The two main endoscopic treatments in case of anastomotic leakage are self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) and the endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT). It is still under debate, if one method is superior to the other. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature to compare the effectiveness and the related morbidity of SEMS and EVT in the treatment of esophageal leakage. We systematically searched for studies comparing SEMS and EVT to treat anastomotic leak after esophageal surgery. Predefined endpoints including outcome, treatment success, endoscopy, treatment duration, re-operation rate, intensive care and hospitalization time, stricture rate, morbidity and mortality were assessed and included in the meta-analysis. Seven retrospective studies including 338 patients matched the inclusion criteria. Compared to stenting, EVT was significantly associated with higher healing (OR 2.47, 95% CI [1.30 to 4.73]), higher number of endoscopic changes (pooled median difference of 3.57 (95% CI [2.24 to 4.90]), shorter duration of treatment (pooled median difference -\u00a011.57\u00a0days; 95% CI [-\u00a017.45 to -\u00a05.69]), and stricture rate (OR 0.22, 95% CI [0.08 to 0.62]). Hospitalization and intensive care unit duration, in-hospital mortality rate, rate of major and treatment related complications, of surgical revisions and of esophago-tracheal fistula failed to show significant differences between the two groups. Our analysis indicates a high potential for EVT, but because of the retrospective design of the included studies with potential biases, these results must be interpreted with caution. More robust prospective randomized trials should further investigate the potential of the two procedures.",

It is the most important cause of chronic liver disease and a major independent cardiovascular risk factor. Lacking a definite treatment for NAFLD, a specific diet and an increase in physical activity represent the most commonly used therapeutic approaches. In this review, major literature data about the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) as a potential treatment of NAFLD have been described. n-3 PUFAs, besides having a beneficial impact on most of the cardio-metabolic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) by regulating gene transcription factors [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein], impacts both lipid metabolism and on insulin sensitivity. In addition to an enhancement of hepatic beta oxidation and a decrease of the endogenous lipid production, n-3 PUFAs are able to determine a significant reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6) and of oxygen reactive species. Further strengthening the results of the in vitro studies, both animal models and human intervention trials, showed a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on the severity of NAFLD as expressed by laboratory parameters and imaging measurements. Despite available results provided encouraging data about the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs as a treatment of NAFLD in humans, well-designed randomized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, with histological endpoints, are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of PUFA, as well as other therapies, for the treatment of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. It is worthwhile to consider that n-3 PUFAs cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from exogenous sources (fish oil, flaxseeds, olive oil) which are typical foods of the Mediterranean diet, known for its beneficial effects in preventing obesity, diabetes and, in turn, cardiovascular events. According to these data, it is important to consider that most of the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs can also be obtained by an equilibrate nutrition program.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Stunning of thyroid remnants after diagnostic scanning (Dx-WBS) using radioactive iodine- (\u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I) may limit the efficacy of I therapy. We aimed to evaluate this assumption in a prospectively designed study. METHODS: Forty patients who underwent thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied and divided into two identical groups: G1 and G2. In the G1 group, no Dx-WBS was performed and the ablation dose was given directly on the basis of the risk stratification; in the G2 group, Dx-WBS was performed with 185 MBq (5 mCi) of \u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I, and ablation was given for a mean number of 11 \u00b1 1.1 days; stunning was found on a semiquantitative basis in all patients. At a mean of 6.5 \u00b1 0.3 months, the ablation success rate (ASR) was evaluated on the basis of Dx-WBS, thyroglobulin levels, and neck sonography. Complete ASR was considered when no \u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I uptake could be seen in the neck or elsewhere, thyroglobulin was less than 2 ng/ml, and neck sonography was negative for any disease-related abnormalities. RESULTS: G1 and G2 groups were completely identical as no significant differences were found between their different characteristics, including the mean ablative dose. ASR was 81.7 and 78.3% in G1 and G2 groups, respectively (P=0.6). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed the mean ablation dose to be the most influential factor in ASR (odds ratio 1.045; 95% confidence interval 0.936-1.1189; P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that stunning had no influence on ASR and is not a point of clinical consideration with respect to this aspect.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The current central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) surveillance rate calculation does not account for multiple concurrent central venous catheters (CVCs). The presence of multiple CVCs creates more points of entry into the bloodstream, potentially increasing CLABSI risk. Multiple CVCs may be used in sicker patients, making it difficult to separate the relative contributions of multiple CVCs and comorbidities to CLABSI risk. We explored the relative impact of multiple CVCs, patient comorbidities, and disease severity on the risk of CLABSI. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: A total of 197 case patients and 201 control subjects with a CVC inserted during hospitalization at a tertiary care academic medical center from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010. METHODS: Multiple CVCs was the exposure of interest; the primary outcome was CLABSI. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) describing the association between CLABSI and multiple CVCs with and without controlling for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores as measures of disease severity and patient comorbidities, respectively. RESULTS: Patients with multiple CVCs (n = 78) showed a 4.2 (95% CI, 2.2-8.4) times greater risk of CLABSI compared with patients with 1 CVC after adjusting for CLABSI risk factors. When including APACHE II and CCI scores, multiple CVCs remained an independent risk factor for CLABSI (OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.7-6.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple CVCs is an independent risk factor for CLABSI even after adjusting for severity of illness. Adjustment for this risk may be necessary to accurately compare rates between hospitals.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term rates of biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in patients with prostate cancer treated with open radical prostatectomy (RP) in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 436 patients who were treated with RP between 1992 and 1997 at our institution. None received adjuvant/salvage therapy in the absence of BCR. The BCR-free, CSM-free and OS rates were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox-regression models were used to test the effect of age, preoperative PSA level, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pT stage, lymph node status, RP Gleason sum and surgical margin status on BCR. RESULTS: The median follow-up of censored patients was 122, 128, and 132 months for, respectively, BCR-free, CSM-free and OS estimates. The 10-year event-free survival rates for the same endpoints were 60%, 94% and 86%, respectively. Preoperative PSA level, RP Gleason sum, pT stage, lymph node status, and surgical margin status were independent predictors of BCR (all adjusted P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the long-term cancer control outcomes after RP from a European country in the PSA era. Our data indicate that RP provides excellent long-term survival rates in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Although approximately 40% of patients have BCR after 10 years of follow-up, the CSM rate after 10 years is as low as 6%.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Adjuvant clopidogrel therapy is essential after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. The frequency with which patients delay filling a clopidogrel prescription after DES implantation and the association of this delay with adverse outcomes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged after DES implantation from 3 large integrated health care systems. Filling a clopidogrel prescription was based on pharmacy dispensing data. The primary end point was all-cause mortality or myocardial infarction (MI). Of 7402 patients discharged after DES implantation, 16% (n=1210) did not fill a clopidogrel prescription on day of discharge and the median time delay was 3 days (interquartile range, 1 to 23 days). Compared with patients filling clopidogrel on day of discharge, patients with any delay in filling clopidogrel had higher death/MI rates during follow-up (14.2% versus 7.9%; P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, patients with any delay had increased risk of death/MI (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.87). Patients with any delay remained at increased risk of adverse outcomes when the delay cutoff was changed to >1, >3, or >5 days after discharge. Factors associated with delay included older age, prior MI, diabetes, renal failure, prior revascularization, cardiogenic shock, in-hospital bleeding, and clopidogrel use within 24 hours of admission. CONCLUSIONS: One in 6 patients delay filling their index clopidogrel prescription after hospital discharge after DES implantation. This delay was associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes and highlights the importance of the transition period from hospital discharge to outpatient setting as a potential opportunity to improve care delivery and patient outcomes.",

We assessed the safety and short-term efficacy of IVT in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the expanded time window delivered through a hub-and-spoke telestroke network. Methods: Observational study of patients with AIS who received IVT at the Stroke Eastern Saxony Telemedical Network between 01/2014 and 12/2015. We compared safety data including symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH; according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II definition) and any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) between patients admitted to telestroke spoke sites and patients directly admitted to a tertiary stroke center representing the hub of the network. We also assessed short-term efficacy data including favorable functional outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale \u2264 2) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at discharge, hospital discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality. Results: In total, 152 patients with AIS were treated with IVT in the expanded time window [spoke sites, n = 104 (26.9%); hub site, n = 48 (25.9%)]. Patients treated at spoke sites had less frequently a large vessel occlusion [8/104 (7.7) vs. 20/48 (41.7%); p < 0.0001], a determined stroke etiology (p < 0.0001) and had slightly shorter onset-to-treatment times [210 (45) vs. 228 (58) min; p = 0.02] than patients who presented to the hub site. Both cohorts did not display any further differences in demographics, vascular risk factors, median baseline NIHSS scores, or median baseline Alberta stroke program early CT score (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the frequency of sICH (4.9 vs. 6.3%; p = 0.71) or any ICH (8.7 vs. 16.7%; p = 0.15). Neither there was a difference regarding favorable functional outcome (44.1 vs. 39.6%; p = 0.6) nor median NIHSS [3 (5.5) vs. 2.5 (5.75); p = 0.92] at discharge, hospital discharge disposition (p = 0.28), or in-hospital mortality (9.6 vs. 8.3%; p = 1.0). Multivariable modeling did not reveal an association between telestroke and sICH or favorable functional outcome (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Delivery of IVT in the expanded 3- to 4.5-h time window through a telestroke network appears to be safe with equivalent short-term functional outcomes for spoke-and-hub center admissions.",

        "a": "AIMS: To study the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections on pain reduction in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA). METHODS: The authors performed a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to retrieve RCTs published up to July 2018. Pain outcomes (visual analog scale scores) were extracted to assess the effect of PRP injections on TMJ OA. All data analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Six studies were included. According to the results of these trials, intra-articular injections of PRP were more effective than placebo for pain reduction (6 months postinjection: mean difference [MD] -2.82, 95% CI -3.39 to -2.25, P < .00001; 12 months postinjection: MD -3.29; 95% CI -4.07 to -2.52, P < .00001). Additionally, the comparison between PRP and hyaluronic acid injections showed a statistically significant difference in pain reduction in support of PRP (MD -0.81; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.40; P = .0001) at 12 months postinjection. All trials revealed a moderate risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence, PRP injections may reduce pain more effectively than placebo injections in TMJ OA at 6 months (level of evidence: moderate) and 12 months (level of evidence: moderate) postinjection. This significant difference in pain reduction could also be seen when PRP was compared to hyaluronic acid at 12 months postinjection (level of evidence: low). It can be cautiously interpreted that PRP has a beneficial effect on the relief of TMJ OA pain. Large-scale, low-bias RCTs are needed to test whether PRP injection should be a routine treatment for patients with TMJ OA.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence from clinical trials suggests that a lower (restrictive) hemoglobin threshold (<8\u00a0g/dL) for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, compared with a higher (liberal) threshold (\u226510 g/dL) is safe. However, in anemic patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), maintaining a higher hemoglobin level may increase oxygen delivery to vulnerable myocardium resulting in improved clinical outcomes. Conversely, RBC transfusion may result in increased blood viscosity, vascular inflammation, and reduction in available nitric oxide resulting in worse clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that a liberal transfusion strategy would improve clinical outcomes as compared to a more restrictive strategy. METHODS: We will enroll 3500 patients with acute MI (type 1, 2, 4b or 4c) as defined by the Third Universal Definition of MI and a hemoglobin <10 g/dL at 144 centers in the United States, Canada, France, Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia. We randomly assign trial participants to a liberal or restrictive transfusion strategy. Participants assigned to the liberal strategy receive transfusion of RBCs sufficient to raise their hemoglobin to at least 10 g/dL. Participants assigned to the restrictive strategy are permitted to receive transfusion of RBCs if the hemoglobin falls below 8 g/dL or for persistent angina despite medical therapy. We will contact each participant at 30 days to assess clinical outcomes and at 180 days to ascertain vital status. The primary end point is a composite of all-cause death or recurrent MI through 30 days following randomization. Secondary end points include all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent adjudicated MI, and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, nonfatal recurrent MI, ischemia driven unscheduled coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting), or readmission to the hospital for ischemic cardiac diagnosis within 30 days. The trial will assess multiple tertiary end points. CONCLUSIONS: The MINT trial will inform RBC transfusion practice in patients with acute MI.",

Stress echocardiography (SE) is routinely used for risk stratification and prognosis of patients with known or suspected CAD. The prognostic value of SE in this high-risk group is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of SE in HIV-infected patients with known or suspected CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 311 patients (age, 52 \u00b1 9 years; 74% men; left ventricular ejection fraction, 54 \u00b1 12%) with history of HIV, undergoing SE (56% dobutamine). Left ventricular wall motion was evaluated on a 16-segment model, 5-point scale. An abnormal SE was defined by a fixed (infarction), biphasic, or new (ischemia) wall motion abnormality on stress. Follow-up for cardiac death and myocardial infarction was obtained. Seventy-nine (26%) patients had an abnormal SE. After 2.9 \u00b1 1.9 years, 17 confirmed myocardial infarction and 14 cardiac deaths occurred. SE risk-stratified patients into normal versus abnormal subgroups (event rate, 0.6% per year versus 11.8% per year; P < 0.0001). Both abnormal SE (hazard ratio, 28.2; 95% confidence interval, 6.2 to 128.0; P < 0.0001) and the presence of any ischemia on SE (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.6; P = 0.009) were independent predictors of cardiac events. On a forward conditional Cox proportional hazards regression model, SE provided incremental prognostic value over clinical, stress ECG, and resting echocardiographic variables (global \u03c7(2) increased from 17.8 to 24.5 to 65 to 109, P < 0.05 across all groups). CONCLUSIONS: SE can effectively risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with HIV. The presence of ischemia and scar during SE provides independent and incremental prognostic value over traditional variables.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Difficulty of lead extraction does not track well with procedural complications, but several small retrospective studies have lead fibrosis on computed tomography as an important indicator of difficult lead extraction. The purpose of the present study was to apply a standardized gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) protocol to assess fibrosis and study it prospectively to examine the need for powered sheaths and risk outcomes. METHODS: We performed a prospective, blinded, multicenter, international study at high-volume lead extraction centers and included patients referred for transvenous lead extraction with at least one lead with a dwell time >1 year and ability to receive a cardiac CT. The degree of fibrosis (as measured by amount of lead adherence to vessel wall) was graded on a scale of 1 to 4 by dedicated CT readers in 3 zones (vein entry to superior vena cava, superior vena cava, and right atrium to lead tip). The primary outcome of the study was number of extractions requiring powered sheaths at zone 2 for each fibrosis group. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the trial with 196 completing full gated CT and lead extraction analysis. The primary endpoint of powered sheath (laser and mechanical) sheath use was significantly higher in patients with higher fibrosis seen on CT (scores 3+4; 67.8%) at the zone 2 compared to patients with lower fibrosis (scores 1+2; 38.6%; P<0.001). There were 5 major complications with 3 vascular lacerations all occurring in zone 2 in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Gated, contrasted CT can predict the need for powered sheaths by identification of fibrosis but did not identify an absolute low-risk cohort who would not need powered sheaths.

Nifekalant was intravenously administered to the halothane-anesthetized dogs in three doses of 0.03, 0.3, and 3 mg/kg/10 minutes with a pause of 20 minutes (n = 6). The low dose hardly affected any of the cardiovascular parameters. The middle dose, a clinically recommended antiarrhythmic dose, decreased the total peripheral resistance, increased the cardiac output, and prolonged the ventricular repolarization phase and effective refractory period. The high dose increased the left ventricular contraction, transiently decreased the mean blood pressure, and enhanced the atrioventricular conduction, besides potentiation of the changes induced by the middle dose. Increment in the repolarization phase by the high dose was greater than that in the refractoriness, leading to increase of ventricular electrical vulnerability. To the atrioventricular block animals, clinically relevant antiarrhythmic dose of 3 mg/kg p.o. of Nifekalant and its 10-times-higher dose were administered. The high dose prolonged QT interval leading to torsades de pointes in all animals (n = 5), which was not detected by the clinical dose (n = 5).

The RSI (ASAT (U/l) divided by Quick (%) multiplied by the extent of liver resection in points) was identified as independent risk factor for OS only in patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of leukocytosis in patients prior resection of CRLM was associated with increased postoperative morbidity and decreased OS and could therefore prove valuable for perioperative risk stratification.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer reduced mastectomy rates by 7% to 13% in randomized trials. However, the differential effects for women with different stages, receptor subtypes, and ages are unknown. We compared mastectomy rates in women who did vs did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 18 patient subgroups. The main objective was to quantify the potential benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy in reducing mastectomy rates for each subgroup. METHODS: Our retrospective analysis used data from the National Cancer Data Base, which includes approximately 70% of incident cancers across the United States. Absolute risk reductions for mastectomy were determined for 18 subgroups of clinical stage, receptor subtype, and age group. In each subgroup, propensity score weighting balanced measured covariates between women treated with vs without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 55\u2009709 patients were analyzed. In clinical stage IIA disease, only patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors had reduced mastectomy rates associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (age < 60\u2009years, 12%; age \u2265 60\u2009years, 12.6%). For stage IIB cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an absolute reduction in mastectomy rates of 5.9% in women younger than age 60\u2009years with hormone receptor-positive/HER2- disease, 8.2% to 10.7% for triple-negative disease, and 11.7% to 17.4% for HER2+ disease. For stage IIIA, the reductions in mastectomy rates ranged from 6.6% to 15.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of patients treated across the United States, we found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a reduction in mastectomy rates to a similar magnitude overall as shown in randomized trials, but this benefit varied widely by patient subgroup. This study provides novel information to help women make informed decisions regarding treatment.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Scoring systems can be used to predict the risk of mortality and outcomes in critically ill patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the strongest factors negatively influencing patient outcomes. Midregional proadrenomedullin (MR\u2011proADM) shows promising results as an outcome predictor in patients with sepsis. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the value of MR\u2011proADM in incident AKI and mortality prognostication among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in comparison with commonly used scoring systems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study included a single\u2011center cohort of 77 patients admitted to the ICU. Plasma MR\u2011proADM levels were measured within 24 h of admission. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were used as a reference. The primary endpoints were incident AKI and in\u2011hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients who died during hospitalization period had a higher MR\u2011proADM concentrations as compared with patients who survived (2592.5 pg/ml vs 995.3 pg/ml; P <0.001). The levels of MR\u2011proADM correlated positively with the APACHE II or SOFA score (r = 0.3; P = 0.004 and r = 0.3; P = 0.008, respectively). In the receiver operating characteristics analysis, MR\u2011proADM concentration was superior to both scoring systems (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). In univariate logistic regression, MR\u2011proADM was associated with in\u2011hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35 per 100 pg/ml increase of MR\u2011proADM) and after adjusting for multiple variables remained an independent predictor of death (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.49 per 100 pg/ml increase of MR\u2011proADM). MR\u2011proADM was not useful in predicting incident AKI. CONCLUSIONS: MR\u2011proADM can be applied in clinical practice as a prognostic tool for mortality but not incident AKI in the general ICU population with at least similar accuracy as APACHE II and SOFA scores.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment often have severe fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances and may even suffer acute kidney injury (AKI). It is often necessary to use continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). In this study, we aimed to retrospectively analyze the prognosis of patients treated with ECMO combined with CRRT and to find the independent factors that affect the survival rate. METHODS: There were 32 patients who were treated with ECMO combined with CRRT in our hospital from January 2007 to December 2017 who were analyzed. All of the patients were divided into a survival group and death group. The clinical indicators and biochemical indexes of the two groups were observed, and their differences were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the independent risk factors. RESULTS: The fluid balance at ECMO day 3, SOFA score and lactate at CRRT initiation, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at ECMO weaning, CRRT duration, ECMO to CRRT interval, mechanical ventilation (MV) duration, length of ICU, and overall hospital length of stay were statistically significant (P<0.05). The clinical biochemical indexes at CRRT initiation and ECMO weaning [serum creatinine, pH, white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), bilirubin]; patient's age, gender and BMI; and the fluid balance at ECMO days 1 and 7 were not statistically significance (P>0.05). The fluid balance at ECMO day 3 and lactate at CRRT initiation by multivariable logistic regression analysis were independent risk factors affecting patient prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The fluid balance at ECMO day 3 and lactate at CRRT initiation are the prognosis independent risk factors for ECMO + CRRT patients.",

        "a": "Background and Study Aims\u2003Surgical treatment for acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) in elderly patients is still considered unsatisfactory. Series focusing on the use of conventional craniotomy or decompressive craniectomy in such patients report discouraging results. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission seems to be crucial in the decision-making process. Deteriorating patients with a GCS score between 9 and 11 are those who would benefit most from the surgical treatment. Unfortunately, elderly patients often present other comorbidities that greatly increase the risk of severe complications after major neurosurgical procedures under general anesthesia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of performing a mini-craniotomy under local anesthesia to treat ASDHs in a select group of elderly patients who were somnolent but still breathing autonomously at admission (GCS 9-11). Material and Methods\u2003Twenty-eight elderly patients (age\u2009>\u200975 years) with ASDH and a GCS score at surgery ranging from 9 to 11 were surgically treated under local anesthesia by a single burr-hole mini-craniotomy (transverse diameter 3-5 cm) and hematoma evacuation. At the end of the procedure, an endoscopic inspection of the surgical cavity was performed to look for residual clots that were not visible under direct vision. Results\u2003The median operation time was 65 minutes. Hematoma evacuation was complete in 22 cases, complete consciousness recovery was observed in all patients but one, and reoperation was required for two patients. Conclusion\u2003Historically, elderly patients with ASDH treated with a traditional craniotomy performed under general anesthesia have not had a good prognosis. Our preliminary experience with this less invasive surgical and anesthesiological approach suggests that somnolent but autonomously breathing elderly patients could benefit from this approach, achieving an adequate hematoma evacuation and bypassing the complications related to intubation and artificial respiratory assistance.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most devastating outcome in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We evaluated repolarisation features on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify the potential risk factors for SCA. METHODS: Data was collected from 52 patients with HCM who underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Leads V2 and V5 from the ECG closest to the time of ICD implant were utilised for measuring the Tpeak-Tend interval (Tpe), QTc, Tpe/QTc, T-wave duration and T-wave amplitude. The presence of the five traditional SCA-associated risk factors was assessed, as well as the HCM risk-SCD score. RESULTS: 16 (30%) patients experienced aborted cardiac arrest over 8.5\u00b14.1\u2005years, with 9 receiving an ICD shock and 7 receiving ATP. On univariate analysis, T-wave amplitude was associated with appropriate ICD therapy (HR per 0.1\u2005mV 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96, p=0.02). Aborted SCA was not associated with a greater mean QTc duration, Tpeak-Tend interval, T-wave duration, or Tpe/QT ratio. Multivariate analysis (adjusting for cardinal HCM SCA-risk factors) showed T-wave amplitude in Lead V2 was an independent predictor of risk (adjusted HR per 0.1\u2005mV 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p=0.03). Addition of T-wave amplitude in Lead V2 to the traditional risk factors resulted in significant improvement in risk stratification (C-statistic from 0.65 to 0.75) but did not improve the performance of the HCM SCD-risk score. CONCLUSIONS: T-wave amplitude is a novel marker of SCA in this high risk HCM population and may provide incremental predictive value to established risk factors. Further work is needed to define the role of repolarisation abnormalities in predicting SCA in HCM.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Systematic review of the literature to evaluate the role of decompressive craniectomy (DC) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), comparing the first major randomized clinical trial on this topic (DECRA) with subsequent literature. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed from 2011 to 2015. Citations were selected using the following inclusion criteria: closed severe TBI and DC. Exclusion criteria included most patients \u226418 years old, \u226420 participants, review articles, DC for reasons other than TBI, or surgical procedures other than DC. Primary outcomes included mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year after injury. Assessment of risk of bias of the randomized controlled trials was also performed. RESULTS: Only 12 of 5528 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria; of these studies, 3 were randomized controlled trials. DC in specific populations does not offer GOS or mortality advantages compared with medical treatment; on the other hand, when DC with open dural flap was compared with an alternative means of decompression, e.g., DC with multiple dural stabs, the latter showed significant advantage in mortality and GOS. Nonrandomized studies showed decreased mortality and increased GOS in patients aged \u226450 years when DC was performed <5 hours after TBI and with Glasgow Coma Scale score >5. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of continued international prospective data collection for assessing types of surgical interventions in addition to DC and their timing in patients who have severe TBI. In addition, in geographic areas with limited access to advanced medical treatment for severe TBI, DC is of benefit when performed <5 hours after injury in younger patients with Glasgow Coma Scale >5.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) has become commonly used in the management of blunt trauma (BT) in high-income countries, but its indications are controversial. Advanced trauma life support recommends conducting head CT for traumatized patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 12. This nationwide study was conducted to verify that WBCT is also beneficial for these patients. METHODS: The Japan Trauma Data Bank (2007-2010) was used to identify BT patients with systolic blood pressure of greater than 75 mm Hg having a GCS score of 3 to 12. Because the probability of survival (Ps) by the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) method was used for severity adjustment, 5,208 patients not lacking variables necessary for TRISS Ps calculation were analyzed. WBCT was defined as CT including all of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis during initial trauma management, and the WBCT group was compared with patients who did not undergo CT of one or more of the body regions (non-WBCT). RESULTS: No significant difference in TRISS Ps was observed between the groups. However, the recorded mortality proportion was significantly lower (p = 0.0002) in the WBCT group (0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.26) than in the non-WBCT group (0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.30). CONCLUSION: In Japan, integration of WBCT into initial trauma management may decrease mortality in BT patients with a GCS score of 3 to 12 for whom head CT is indicated.",

Patients listed between 16 March 2005 and 30 June 2008 were included. Probability of dropout was estimated using a CR technique as well as a Cox model for time to dropout. Overall, non-HCC patients had a higher dropout rate from the WL than HCC patients (p < 0.0001). This was reproducible throughout all regions. In Cox regression, tumor size, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were associated with increased dropout risk. Multivariable analysis with CR showed that MELD score and AFP, were most influential in predicting dropout for HCC patients. The index of concordance for predicting dropout with the CR was 0.70. HCC patients appear to be advantaged in the current allocation scheme based on lower dropout rates without regard to geography.

We hypothesized that dipstick albuminuria (DA) is associated with a lower rate of AKI recovery in septic patients. METHODS: This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of adults with sepsis-associated AKI in an urban academic intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with unknown baseline serum creatinine (SCr), absent urinalysis, and those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min per 1.73m(2) or receiving chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. The independent variable was DA (negative or trace, 30 mg/dL, and \u2265100 mg/dL) within the first 72 h of ICU stay. The outcome variable was AKI recovery at 30 days following hospital discharge, defined as the last SCr returning to a level less than 1.5 times the baseline SCr level and independence of RRT. RESULTS: A total of 988 patients were included in the study. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days. The patients with higher degree of DA had worse critical illness scores. After adjustment for several confounders, DA \u226530 mg/dL was independently associated with \"no AKI recovery\" at 30 days post-discharge (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01-1.95 for DA =30 mg/dL and 1.67, 1.15-2.42 for DA \u2265100 mg/dL, P =\u20090.02). Other independent predictors of \"no AKI recovery\" were cumulative fluid balance, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, exposure to diuretics, and the need for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Dipstick albuminuria \u226530 mg/dL is independently associated with lower rate of AKI recovery at 30 days post-discharge. Our findings emphasize the potential utility of a simple routine test of DA in the risk-stratification of AKI recovery in ICU septic patients.",

However, immune escape mechanisms may cause inferior NK cell activity (NKA) in patients with cancer. This prospective study examined the relationship between NKA and lung cancer in a high-risk cohort. METHODS: In a cohort study, 250 participants referred by their general practitioner for suspicion of lung cancer were included. Before clinical investigation, blood was collected into NK Vue tubes, and the level of interferon gamma after 24 hours served as a surrogate marker for NKA. RESULTS: Among 250 patients, 79 were diagnosed with lung cancer. No difference in NKA was found between patients with lung cancer and control participants in which lung cancer was ruled out (median 226\u2009pg/mL vs. 450\u2009pg/mL). However, there was a significant difference in NKA between patients with late-stage lung cancer and controls (median 161\u2009pg/mL vs. 450\u2009pg/mL). A linear regression model showed that NKA was not influenced by age, sex or smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly lower NKA in patients with late-stage lung cancer warrants further investigation combining NKA with other biomarkers and examining the potential role of NKA as a marker of disseminated disease.",

        "a": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Isolated distal deep-vein thrombosis (iDDVT) is a distal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) without proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism. Although its clinical significance is uncertain, its prevalence is increasing with the use of whole leg compression ultrasonography. Epidemiological data giving reported rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are scarce, and there is potential conflict regarding the need to treat with anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, iDDVT management varies widely from one country/physician to another. RECENT FINDINGS: Data are available from two large multicenter observational studies of iDDVT and proximal DVT without pulmonary embolism (iPDVT), comparing risk factor profiles and early prognosis, and also from clinical trials on iDDVT. SUMMARY: iDDVT and iPDVT differ in terms of risk factor profile, iPDVT being more associated with chronic risk factors and iDDVT with transient ones. In the short term, case fatality rates associated with iDDVT suggest that it is a clinically relevant entity and should at least be diagnosed. From a therapeutic point of view, differences in population profile and outcomes between iPDVT and iDDVT, and results from recent clinical trials in favor of a modest VTE potential of iDDVT indicate that specific randomized double-blind trials are necessary to determine an appropriate and accepted mode of care for iDDVT.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Proton therapy may reduce cognitive deficits after radiotherapy among brain tumor survivors, although current data are limited to retrospective comparisons between historical cohorts. The authors compared intelligence quotient scores within a case-matched cohort of children with medulloblastoma treated with proton radiation (PRT) or photon radiation (XRT) over the same time period. METHODS: Among 88 consecutive patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma treated with PRT or XRT at 2 institutions from 2000 to 2009, 50 were matched 1:1 (25 with PRT and 25 with XRT) according to age, gender, date of diagnosis, histology, radiation boost, and craniospinal irradiation dose. One-way analyses of variance were performed to compare the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) and associated index scores between the 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Neurocognitive data were available for 37 survivors (17 with PRT and 20 with XRT) from the matched cohort. The mean age was 8.5 years (SD, 4.14 years). The median follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 1.0-11.4 years) and 4.6 years (range, 1.1-11.2 years) for the PRT and XRT cohorts, respectively (P = .193). Patients treated with PRT had significantly higher mean FSIQ (99.6 vs 86.2; P = .021), verbal (105.2 vs 88.6; P = .010), and nonverbal scores (103.1 vs 88.9; P = .011) than the XRT-treated cohort. Differences in processing speed (82.9 vs 77.2; P = .331) and working memory (97.0 vs 92.7; P = .388) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-associated cognitive effects appear to be more attenuated after proton therapy. Comprehensive prospective studies are needed to appropriately evaluate the neurocognitive advantages of proton therapy.",

METHODS: For this retrospective study, information was extracted from patients notes and billing records for patients >18 years of age with a diagnosis of AKI admitted to the ICU department, Ningbo First Hospital from April 2013 to March 2018. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients with sepsis admitted to ICU, 167 (45%) developed AKI; 95 patients were insured and 72 were uninsured. Compared with insured patients, uninsured patients were younger, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, but had less catheter interventions and received less renal replacement therapy (RRT). Results from a multivariate analysis showed that independent predictors of ICU mortality were age, APACHE II scores, MODS scores, use of RRT and lack of insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Uninsured patients with septic AKI were younger, stayed a shorter time in ICU, had higher illness severity scores and a higher ICU mortality than insured patients. Importantly a major risk factor for ICU mortality in this group was lack of insurance.",

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is not only a diagnostic tool for DM but may also has prognostic value for diabetic and non-diabetic populations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between HbA1c level on admission and clinical outcome among patients admitted to the ICU due to cardiopulmonary disorders with hyperglycemia. METHODS: Patients consecutively admitted to the ICU due to cardiopulmonary disorders who presented with hyperglycemia at admission were evaluated during a 6-month period. HbA1c and serum glucose levels were tested on admission and during the first 24-48 hours of hospitalization. Patients were divided according to HbA1c and compared in term of demographics. We evaluated the effect of HbA1c levels at admission on the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of patients with cardiopulmonary disorders who presented with hyperglycemia at admission to the ICU, 73 had HbA1c levels \u2265 6%, 92 had HbA1c levels < 6%: 63/165 (38.2%) known as diabetic patients. The 30-day all-cause mortality was higher in the group with high HbA1c levels; 38/73 vs. 32/98 (P = 0.02). Increased length of stay in the ICU and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score were associated with HbA1c \u2265 6% (P < 0.022 and P < 0.026), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c \u2265 6% has an important clinical prognostic value among diabetic and non-diabetic patients with cardiopulmonary disorders and hyperglycemia.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H.\u00a0pylori) infections are of serious concern due to the associated risk of gastric cancer. However, many patients have poor medication and therapy compliance, which makes it difficult to eradicate their infections. This points to the need for stronger educational interventions aimed at enhancing compliance, thus increasing the potential for treatment success. As such, this study conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the effects of enhanced patient education (EPE) programs for H.\u00a0pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on health education for patients infected with H.\u00a0pylori from inception to June 2021. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H.\u00a0pylori, while the secondary outcomes included the incidence of individual adverse symptoms, treatment compliance, clinical symptom remission after treatment, and patient satisfaction. We used the fixed or random-effects model to pool the risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval. We also conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Our search returned seven relevant studies across a total of 1,433 patients. Compared with controls, EPE was significantly associated with improved H. pylori eradication rates (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.16, 95%CI: 1.04-1.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and patient compliance (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.48, 95%CI: 1.14-1.93, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). A subgroup analysis also showed that EPE benefits were consistent across patients with different eradication programs, WeChat intervention plans, and intervention frequencies (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, there were no significant differences in the total adverse effects, common side effects (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, taste disorder, and skin rash), or discontinuation rate (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient education is inexpensive, safe, and convenient. In this context, our findings suggest that enhanced educational interventions have positive effects on both the H.\u00a0pylori eradication rate and adherence among infected patients, and thus constitute promising complements to clinical treatment regimens.",

This study evaluated the impact of microsurgical anastomotic technique on outcomes of lower extremity reconstructions, with a focus on patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). METHODS: \u2003Over a 6-year period, 425 patients underwent 437 microvascular lower extremity free flap reconstructions with fasciocutaneous anterolateral thigh- or gracilis muscle flaps at a single surgical center. The cases were divided into an ETE (n\u2009=\u2009297 patients) versus ETS (n\u2009=\u2009128 patients) group according to the anastomotic technique. A retrospective analysis of patients' demographics, perioperative details, surgical complications, free flap types, recipient sites, flap survival, and the potential impact of PAD on outcomes was performed. Patient groups were comparable regarding comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, types of performed free flaps and recipient sites. RESULTS: \u2003We found no significant differences between the ETE versus ETS groups regarding the rate of major or minor complications (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Specifically, in patients suffering from PAD (n\u2009=\u200964) the type of arterial anastomosis had no effect on the outcome. CONCLUSION: \u2003Overall, no significant differences in outcomes were observed when comparing the types of performed arterial anastomosis. This observation also held true for the subgroup of patients with PAD. Given that an ETS anastomosis did not increase the risk to encounter complications while preserving distal perfusion, we believe that this technique is the method of choice, especially in patients with impaired vascular status.",

        "a": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of Sleep Profiler, which relies on ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) with electroencephalogram for sleep bruxism (SB) and examined its episode-by-episode agreement in comparison to PSG equipped with audiovisual recordings (avPSG). METHODS: This prospective 2-gate study recruited 10 individuals with probable SB and 10 healthy volunteers. Overnight experimental recordings were performed simultaneously using the ambulatory PSG with masseter electromyography and avPSG with masseter and temporalis electromyography. Sleep staging was performed manually for avPSG and automatically or manually for ambulatory PSG. SB episodes were manually scored based on electromyography signals with reference to sleep stages. The episode-by-episode agreement was analyzed by setting avPSG as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of SB were calculated after optimizing the cutoff values of the episode index and the burst index. RESULTS: Regarding the episode-by-episode agreement, median sensitivities were 0.825 and positive predictive values were approximately 0.6, regardless of the sleep staging procedure, indicating that approximately 40% of the overall total SB episodes scored by the ambulatory PSG were false positives. Because of overestimation of SB episodes, the optimal cutoff values for the episode index and the burst index were approximately 1.5 times higher than the avPSG-based cutoff values and dramatically improved the diagnostic precision metrics for the ambulatory PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep Profiler can eliminate events during wakefulness by electroencephalogram and may provide a definitive diagnosis in patients with possible SB by applying optimized cutoff values. However, the risk of overestimation must be recognized.

However, there is still a lack of evidence for the long-term outcome in distally located aneurysms in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and beyond. METHODS: Consecutive subjects (from June 2013 to August 2020) with MCA aneurysms in the M2 segment or beyond treated with FDS were reviewed retrospectively. The primary endpoints for clinical safety were the absence of mortality, stroke event, re-rupture of the aneurysm, and worsening of clinical symptoms. The primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was complete/near-complete occlusion at follow-up after 12 months. RESULTS: 23 patients were identified: 7 aneurysms were located in the M2 segment of the MCA, 4 in the M2-M3 bifurcation, 2 in M3, 3 in M3-4 branching, and 2 in M4; 5 aneurysms were located in M2 with extension into the M1-M2 bifurcation. 13 aneurysms were of fusiform morphology, 8 sacculofusiform, and 2 saccular. 16 aneurysms were of highly suspected dissecting etiology. The median diameter of the parent vessel was 2.1\u2009mm proximally and 2\u2009mm distally. The median time of the follow-up was 30 months (range 16\u2009months to 6\u2009years). Complete/near complete occlusion was observed in 14/20 patients (70%) and one stable remodeling (5%) was seen at 12\u2009months. 22 patients (95.6%) had an excellent clinical outcome (mRS 0-1) at 6\u2009months. Technical challenges associated with the deployment of FDS occurred in 8.7% of cases. Severe complications, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and re-rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 2 patients (8.7%). CONCLUSION: Flow diversion of distally located aneurysms is technically feasible with low morbidity and mortality.",

METHODS: A 28-item vision symptom questionnaire was completed by 107 adult subjects (mean age 42.1, 16.2 SD, range 18-75) who self-reported as having sustained mild-to-moderate TBI and two groups of reference adult subjects (first-year optometry students: mean age 23.2, 2.8 SD, range 20-39; and 71 third-year optometry students: mean age 26.0, 2.9 SD, range 22-42) without TBI. Both a Likert-style method of analysis with factor analysis and a Rasch analysis were used. Logistic regression was used to determine sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: At least 27 of 28 questions were completed by 93.5% of TBI subjects, and all 28 items were completed by all of the 157 reference subjects. BIVSS sensitivity was 82.2% for correctly predicting TBI and 90.4% for correctly predicting the optometry students. Factor analysis identified eight latent variables; six factors were positive in their risk for TBI. Other than dry eye and double vision, the TBI patients were significantly more symptomatic than either cohort of optometry students by at least one standard deviation (p < 0.001). Twenty-five of 28 questions were within limits for creating a single-dimension Rasch scale. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all of the adult TBI subjects were able to self-complete the BIVSS, and there was significant mean score separation between TBI and non-TBI groups. The Rasch analysis revealed a single dimension associated with TBI. Using the Likert method with the BIVSS, it may be possible to identify different vision symptom profiles with TBI patients. The BIVSS seems to be a promising tool for better understanding the complex and diverse nature of vision symptoms that are associated with brain injury.",

        "a": "Overexpression of the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2/HER2/Neu, occurs in 25%-30% of invasive breast cancer (BC) with poor patient prognosis. Even if numerous studies have shown prevention of breast cancer by n-3 fatty acid intake, the experimental conditions under which n-3 fatty acids exert their protective effect have been variable from study to study, preventing unifying conclusions. Due to confounding factors, inconsistencies still remain regarding protective effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on BC. When animals are fed with dietary supplementation in n-3 fatty acids (the traditional approach to modify tissue content and decrease the n-6/n-3 ratio) complex dietary interactions can occur among dietary lipids (antioxidants, vitamins\u2026) that can modulate the activity of n-3 fatty acids. So, what are the specific roles of these n-3 PUFA in reducing breast cancer risk and particularly preventing HER2-positive breast cancer? In this review, we discuss crucial points that may account for discrepancies of results and provide a highly effective genetic approach that can eliminate confounding factors of diet for evaluating the molecular mechanisms of n-3 PUFA in HER2 signaling pathway regulation. The fat-1 transgenic mouse model is capable of converting n-6 to n-3 fatty acids leading to an increase in n-3 fatty acid content with a balanced n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio in all tissues. The fat-1 mouse model allows well-controlled studies in HER2-positive breast cancer prevention to be performed, without the conflict of potential confounding factors of diet.",

METHODS: Of 1,025 cirrhotic patients who underwent HVPG measurement, data on 572 non-critically-ill patients were collected retrospectively between 2008 and 2013. The following two HS categorizations were used: HS-1 (6-9, 10-12, 13-16, 17-20, and > 20 mmHg; designated as groups 1-5, respectively) and HS-2 (6-12, 13-20, and > 20 mmHg). Clinical characteristics, mortality rates, and prognostic predictors were analyzed according to the categorized HS. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 25 months, 86 (15.0%) patients died. The numbers of deaths in HS-1 groups were 7 (6.3%), 7 (6.9%), 30 (18.0%), 20 (15.6%), and 22 (34.4%), respectively (P < 0.001). However, the traditional HVPG cutoffs of 10 and 16 mmHg did not improve the discrimination of mortality. In contrast, the mortality rates did differ significantly between the three HS-2 groups (P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, all models revealed that HS-2 was a common prognostic factor in predicting mortality. The mortality rates increased significantly according to HS-2 in patients with hypoalbuminemia (HVPG, 13-20 mmHg; hazard ratio [HR], 2.54 and HVPG > 20 mmHg; HR, 5.45) and intermediate model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (HVPG, 13-20 mmHg; HR, 3.86 and HVPG > 20 mmHg; HR, 8.77; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Categorizing HVPG values according to HS-2 is a useful prognostic modality in patients with portal hypertension and can play an independent role in predicting the prognosis in patients with hypoalbuminemia and an intermediate MELD score.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify a group of patients with a low risk of seizure after surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of seizure after discharge from surgery for UIA. METHODS: A consecutive prospectively collected cohort database was interrogated for all surgical UIA cases. There were 726 cases of UIA (excluding cases proximal to the superior cerebellar artery on the vertebrobasilar system) identified and analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier life table analyses were generated assessing risk factors. RESULTS: Preoperative seizure history and complication of aneurysm repair were the only risk factors found to be significant. The risk of first seizure after discharge from hospital following surgery for patients with neither preoperative seizure, treated middle cerebral artery aneurysm, nor postoperative complications (leading to a modified Rankin Scale score >1) was <0.1% and 1.1% at 12 months and 7 years, respectively. The risk for those with preoperative seizures was 17.3% and 66% at 12 months and 7 years, respectively. The risk for seizures with either complications (leading to a modified Rankin Scale score >1) from surgery or treated middle cerebral artery aneurysm was 1.4% and 6.8% at 12 months and 7 years, respectively. These differences in the 3 Kaplan-Meier curves were significant (log-rank P < .001). CONCLUSION: The risk of seizures after discharge from hospital following surgery for UIA is very low when there is no preexisting history of seizures. If this result can be supported by other series, guidelines that restrict returning to driving because of the risk of postoperative seizures should be reconsidered.

In this context, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to be a neurohumoral marker for left ventricular dysfunction, because myocardial strain and ischemia both increase BNP concentration. The present study was designed to test if BNP allows for identification of patients at risk for developing sepsis-induced myocardial depression and if an increased concentration of BNP is associated with an adverse outcome in patients with septic shock. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, 93 patients with septic shock were divided into one group with normal ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction >50%) on days 3 to 5 (n = 38) and another group of patients with impaired left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction <50%) on days 3 to 5 (n = 55). Patients with impaired left ventricular function had an increased median plasma BNP concentration on day 5 (699 [608 of 795.5] pg/nL vs. 86 [71.3 of 93] pg/nL) and an ejection fraction of 38 +/- 6% on day 5 vs. 58 +/- 7% in patients without impaired left ventricular function. There was a close inverse relation between increased plasma BNP concentrations and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05). BNP measured at days 3 and 5 revealed an association with the end point of survival. In the proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age, male gender, and creatinine concentration, measured at days 0, 3, 5, and 12, BNP concentration at day 5 showed an increased hazard for reaching the end point (hazard ratio: 1.407; 95% confidence interval: 1.033-1.916; p = 0.030). In an additional receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the predictive value of a model including cardiovascular risk factors and additional BNP concentration on day 5, compared with a baseline model of cardiovascular risk factors, improved the area under the curve the most; therefore, this model was suited best for prediction of sepsis-induced myocardial depression and 30-day survival for patients with septic shock. Area under the curve of this model combined with BNP concentration at day 5 for death after 30 days (0.65) impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (0.94) and sepsis-induced myocardial depression (0.96). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that plasma BNP concentration represents a reliable marker for identification of patients developing sepsis-induced myocardial depression. In addition, BNP concentration on day 5 may be used as a prognostic marker to identify patients with an elevated risk for an adverse outcome.",

        "a": "The objective of this study was to assess the applicability and usefulness of the Laboratory Risk Indicator in Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) score in patients from our institution. A retrospective analysis was undertaken of the case notes of all patients admitted to our facility between January 2002 and December 2005 with the admission diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis and the application of the LRINEC score upon the initial blood tests. The sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were then calculated for patients with a LRINEC score of > or = 6 compared with the findings of a surgical biopsy. Twenty-eight patients were identified as having the admission diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis on the hospital database and were eligible for the study. Ten of these had biopsy-proven necrotising fasciitis. With a cut-off score of > or = 6, the LRINEC score had a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 67%, a positive predictive value of 57% and a negative predictive value of 86% in distinguishing the patients with proven necrotising fasciitis from those with severe soft tissue infections. The likelihood ratio of a positive biopsy was 2.4 and the likelihood ratio of a negative biopsy was 0.3. A cut-off value of > or = 6 of the LRINEC score was not overly sensitive or specific, and the likelihood ratios suggest that, at this cut-off level, the LRINEC score would have only a very small effect on the post-test probability of the patients in the studied population having necrotising fasciitis.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Vascular disease recurrence following stroke is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. The MITICO study was designed to assess the prognostic value of markers of inflammation in relation to the risk of recurrence of vascular disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multi-centered prospective observational study, in patients with ischemic stroke not receiving anti-coagulation therapy and who were recruited within 1-3 months from stroke onset. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and follow- up for the determination of high-sensitive C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-10, ICAM-1, VCAM- 1, MMP-9 and cellular fibronectin. Four follow-up visits within the first year were to rule out recurrence. RESULTS: Of 965 patients from 65 hospitals, 780 (aged 67.5+/-11.2 years, 33.6 % female) were valid for main analysis. One-hundred and three patients (13.2 %) had a new adverse vascular event and 116 patients (14.9 %) a vascular event or vascular death (66.4 % stroke, 21.5 % coronary and 12.1 % peripheral). Levels of IL-6 > 5 pg/mL and VCAM-1 > 1350 ng/mL (ROC curve analyses) were associated with vascular disease recurrence risk (OR: 28.7; 95 % CI: 14.2-58.0 vs. OR: 4.1; 95 % CI: 2.4-7.1, respectively) following adjustment for confounding variables. Risk of adverse vascular event or death from vascular disease were associated with IL-6 (OR: 21.2; 95 % CI: 11.6-38.7) and VCAM-1 (OR: 3.8; 95 % CI: 2.3-6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline values of IL-6 > 5 pg/mL and VCAM-1 > 1350 ng/mL increase 21-fold and 4-fold, respectively, the risk of new vascular disease event or death from vascular disease in patients with ischemic stroke not receiving anti-coagulation treatment.",

        "a": "AIMS: Propofol sedation has been shown to be safe for atrial fibrillation ablation and internal cardioverter-defibrillator implantation but its use for catheter ablation (CA) of ventricular tachycardia (VT) has yet to be evaluated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that VT ablation can be performed using propofol sedation administered by trained nurses under a cardiologist's supervision. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data of 205 procedures (157 patients, 1.3 procedures/patient) undergoing CA for sustained VT under propofol sedation were analysed. The primary endpoint was change of sedation and/or discontinuation of propofol sedation due to side effects and/or haemodynamic instability. Propofol cessation was necessary in 24 of 205 procedures. These procedures (Group A; n = 24, 11.7%) were compared with those with continued propofol sedation (Group B; n = 181, 88.3%). Propofol sedation was discontinued due to hypotension (n = 22; 10.7%), insufficient oxygenation (n = 1, 0.5%), or hypersalivation (n = 1, 0.5%). Procedures in Group A were significantly longer (210 [180-260] vs. 180 [125-220] min, P = 0.005), had a lower per hour propofol rate (3.0 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 3.8 \u00b1 1.2 mg/kg of body weight/h, P = 0.004), and higher cumulative dose of fentanyl administered (0.15 [0.13-0.25] vs. 0.1 [0.05-0.13] mg, P < 0.001), compared with patients in Group B. Five (2.4%) adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Sedation using propofol can be safely performed for VT ablation under the supervision of cardiologists. Close haemodynamic monitoring is required, especially in elderly patients and during lengthy procedures, which carrying a higher risk for systolic blood pressure decline.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether serum homocitrulline (HCit), a characteristic carbamylation-derived product, was related to the presence and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Forty-five control subjects and 109 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. After coronary angiography, the patients were classified as non-CAD patients (patients with normal arteries, n=33) and CAD patients (n=76). The severity of CAD was then evaluated using the Gensini scoring system. Serum total HCit concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Serum HCit concentrations were significantly (p<0.001) higher in CAD patients than in control or non-CAD subjects. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve equal to 0.908 (95% confidence interval, 0.853-0.964, p<0.001) and a threshold HCit concentration of 0.16 mmol/mol Lys for predicting the presence of CAD (78.9% sensitivity and 78.8% specificity). HCit concentrations significantly (p<0.001) increased concomitantly with the severity of CAD and were positively correlated with Gensini scores (r=0.725, p<0.001) as well as with the number of stenotic coronary arteries (p<0.001). Furthermore, in a multiple stepwise regression analysis, HCit was significantly (p<0.001) and independently associated with the presence of CAD, the Gensini score, and the number of stenotic arteries (standardized \u03b2 values of 0.525, 0.722, and 0.642, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that serum HCit concentrations are increased during CAD and are positively associated with the severity of the disease.",

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 147 and 138 patients with nonfunctioning and secretory pituitary adenomas, respectively. Health status was evaluated in 8 domains using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey before and 3 months after transsphenoidal surgery. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness were used to assess the psychological status. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy population reference values, general physical and mental health, social functioning, and role limitations due to physical and psychological health problems were all found to be significantly impaired in the adenoma patients. Health status was worse in patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone- (ACTH-) secreting and growth hormone- (GH-) secreting adenomas than in patients with nonfunctioning adenomas. Among the patients, 11.6% had anxiety and 30.9% had depression. Higher scores for anxiety, depression, and disease stigma; older age; higher body mass index; and tumor recurrence were independent risk factors for health status impairment in at least one domain. Physical function impairment and role limitations caused by physical health problems became worse after surgery, whereas the mental component of health status remained the same. CONCLUSION: Health status was impaired in patients with pituitary adenomas, especially secretory adenomas. Physical function and role limitations were worse 3 months after surgery than before surgery. Mental problems, old age, obesity, and tumor recurrence reduced health status.",

        "a": "The prognosis for men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is limited, and patients have very few treatment options, particularly if the treatment failed with docetaxel (Taxotere). As a result, there is a requirement for novel approaches to therapy. Using immunotherapy to induce immune responses to prostate cancer in preclinical and clinical studies appears to be a valid therapeutic approach. In a pivotal phase III trial, treatment with sipuleucel-T, an autologous cellular vaccine consisting of activated antigen-presenting cells loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), gave a median overall survival of 25.8 months compared with 21.7 months for placebo-treated patients, resulting in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death. Based on these results, sipuleucel-T became the first therapeutic vaccine approved for any type of cancer in the USA. PROSTVAC(\u00ae)-VF, a poxvirus-based vaccine engineered to present prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and three immune costimulatory molecules, and GVAX, a vaccine consisting of two prostate cancer cell lines (LnCAP and PC3) and genetically modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), both showed promising results in phase II studies, although GVAX failed to meet its primary end point of overall survival when compared with docetaxel in a phase III study. T-cell modulation is another potential immunotherapeutic strategy for CRPC. Ipilimumab, an antibody against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, is being evaluated in phase I/II studies, both alone and in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or GVAX, with activity in prostate cancer. CRPC is one of the few tumour types where immunotherapy is the current standard of care. Further research, however, will be necessary to improve antitumour responses and clinical benefits, including the use of novel combinatorial approaches.",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: High-volume tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 1,459 consecutive patients undergoing LT between January 2008 and December 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: MACE, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality were modeled using logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection surgery regression, random forests, support vector machine, and gradient-boosted modeling (GBM). All models were built by splitting data into training and testing cohorts, and performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Harrell's C statistic. A total of 1,459 patients were included in the final cohort; 1,425 (97.7%) underwent index transplantation, 963 (66.0%) were female, the median age at transplantation was 57 (11-70) years, and the median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 20 (6-40). Across all outcomes, the GBM model XGBoost achieved the highest performance, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.79) for MACE, a Harrell's C statistic of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.73) for overall survival, and 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.85) for cardiovascular mortality over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. Examination of Shapley values for the GBM model revealed that on the cohort-wide level, the top influential factors for postoperative MACE were age at transplantation, diabetes, serum creatinine, cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, right ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models developed using data from a tertiary care transplantation center achieved good discriminant function in predicting post-LT MACE, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. These models can support clinicians in recipient selection and help screen individuals who may be at elevated risk for post-transplantation MACE.",

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is frequently neglected in patients with COPD. We aimed at evaluating the rate of osteoporosis, fractures, and low lean mass in patients with COPD. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with COPD (53 women, 64.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6\u00a0years old, and 46 men, 65.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\u00a0years old) underwent bone densitometry (DXA) with body composition analyses. Healthy individuals (N\u2009=\u200957) not exposed to tobacco matched by sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) were used as controls. Spirometry, routine laboratory workout, and conventional thoracolumbar radiography surveying for vertebral deformities were performed in all patients. RESULTS: Osteoporosis was found in 40.4% of the COPD patients against only 13.0% of the healthy controls (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Vertebral fractures were seen in 24.4% of the men and 22.0% of the women with COPD. Disease severity (GOLD 3 and 4) was significantly associated with higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (p\u2009=\u20090.032), lower BMD (both men and women at all sites), higher frequency of osteoporosis (in women at all sites), lower skeletal mass index, and higher rate of low lean mass (in both men and women) than healthy controls and COPD patients with milder disease (GOLD 1 and 2). Age was a main predictor of vertebral fractures (OR\u2009=\u20091.164 (1.078-9.297); p\u2009<\u20090.001), while high plasma iPTH (OR\u2009=\u20091.045 (1.005-1.088); p\u2009=\u20090.029) and low ALM (OR\u2009=\u20090.99965 (0.99933-0.99997); p\u2009=\u20090.031) were predictors of non-vertebral fractures.

RV dysfunction increases risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to characterize the change in perioperative RV long-axis and global function by determining the influence of procedure type, surgical approach, and reoperative status and examining its temporal relationship to pericardiotomy versus cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardioplegia. METHODS: Standardized transesophageal echocardiographic examinations (TEEs) were prospectively performed in 109 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral or aortic valve surgery, and/or aortic surgery via full sternotomy, mini-sternotomy, or right thoracotomy. Mid-esophageal, 4-chamber views centered on the RV were recorded at 4 intraoperative time points, following: (1) anesthetic induction; (2) pericardiotomy; (3) CPB; and (4) chest closure. Long-axis RV function was assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and 2-dimensional longitudinal RV strain, and global RV function by fractional area change (FAC), calculated off-line from 2-dimensional TEE images. RESULTS: TEE measures of RV function were significantly reduced after CPB compared with baseline (baseline vs after CPB: TAPSE 2.2 [Q1, Q3: 1.8, 2.5] vs 1.5 [1.1, 1.7] mm; RV strain -22 [-24, -18] vs -16 [-20, -14] %; FAC 45 [35, 51] vs 42 [34, 49] %), but not after pericardiotomy. Reduced RV function persisted after chest closure: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 1.3 [1.0, 1.6] mm, RV strain -16 [-18, -13]%, FAC 38 [31, 46] %. Reduced function was demonstrated across cardiac surgical procedures, approaches, and primary and reoperative surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Acute intraoperative reduction in RV function occurs following CPB, independent of procedural characteristics and pericardiotomy.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (TSCI) is relatively uncommon, yet a devastating and costly condition. Despite the human and social impacts, studies describing patients with potential TSCI in the pre-hospital setting are scarce. This paper aims to describe the epidemiology of patients potentially at risk of or suspected to have a TSCI by paramedics, with a view to providing a better understanding of factors associated with potential TSCI. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients managed and transported by Ambulance Victoria (AV) between 01 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 who, based on meeting pre-hospital triage protocols and criteria for spinal clearance, paramedic suspicion or spinal immobilisation, were classified to be at risk of or suspected to have a TSCI. Data was extracted from the AV data warehouse, including demographic details, trauma aetiology, paramedic assessment, management and other event characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 106,059cases were included in the study, representing 2.3\u00a0% of all emergency transports by AV. Subjects had a median age of 51\u00a0years (interquartile range; 29-78) and 52.4\u00a0% were males (95\u00a0% CI 52-52.7). Males were significantly younger than females (M: 43\u00a0years [26-65] vs. F: 64\u00a0years [36-84], p =0.001). Falls and traffic accidents were the leading causes of injuries, comprising 46.9 and 39.4\u00a0% of cases, respectively. Other causes included accidents due to sport, animals, industrial work and diving, as well as violence and hanging. 29.9\u00a0% of patients were transported to a Major Trauma Service (MTS). A proportion of 48.8\u00a0% of the study population met the Pre-hospital Major Trauma criteria. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to describe the epidemiology of potential TSCI in Australia and is based on a large, state-wide sample. It provides background knowledge and a baseline for future research, as well as a reference point for future in policy. Falling and traffic related injuries were the leading causes of potential SCI. Future research is required to identify the proportion of confirmed TSCI among the potentials and factors associated with TSCI in prehospital settings.",

MATERIAL AND METHOD: retrospective study conducted at the University Hospital Reina Sof\u00eda. All patients aged 65 years or older admitted to internal medicine in 2011. The sample size was calculated taking into account the income of the previous year, and considering a prevalence of malnutrition of 50% with a 95% and included error of 5%. To define the degree of malnutrition nutritional control tool (CONUT), which establishes a score based on albumin, total cholesterol and lymphocyte determination was used. To determine the factors associated with the presence of moderate to severe malnutrition analysis of multivariate logistic regression was performed. For each patient the EHS, premature readmissions and the associated cost to EHS was calculated. A threshold of statistical significance of 0.05 was used for all analyzes and were performed with SPSS v15.0. RESULTS: 310 patients, of whom 54.2% were women were included, the mean age was 80.1 years (SD: 6.8), ranging between 65 and 95 years. Regarding diagnosis at admission 27.4% were respiratory diseases, 22.6% of the circulatory and digestive 11.6%. The median Charlson index was 2.0, found that 36.8% of patients had high comorbidity. The most prevalent chronic diseases were diabetes mellitus (44.2%), chronic kidney disease (25.2%) and dementia (10.6). Regarding the CONUT, 75.8% of patients met the criteria of malnutrition: 42.6% mild, 28.7% moderate and severe 4.5%, of which only 46.6% had some nutritional support during admission. Factors associated with the presence of moderate to severe malnutrition were female gender (OR: 1.7; 95%: 1.1 - 2.8), age over 80 years (OR: 2.0, IC 95%: 1.2 - 3.5), and dementia (OR: 2.4; IC 95%:1.2 - 5.2). No association with comorbidity or with other chronic diseases was found. Regarding the EHS (days) differences between patients with moderate to severe malnutrition (4.7; IC 95%: 2.3 - 7.1) and normally nourished (-0.1; IC 95%: -1.4 - 1.2) (p = 0.001) were found, but were not for cases of mild malnutrition (1.6, 95%: 0.5-2.8) (p = 0.07).Regarding the rate of premature readmission in malnourished patients was 28/235 (11.9%). The cost associated with EHS / 100 patients was \u20ac 195 479.4 for moderate malnutrition, mild malnutrition \u20ac 73 484.8, and normally nourished patients represented a saving of \u20ac 12 353. CONCLUSIONS: hospital malnutrition in elderly patients remains an unsolved problem, given the high prevalence found, associated to an excess of hospital stay and increased hospital costs, especially in patients with moderate to severe malnutrition. The CONUT is a nutritional screening tool very useful for the speed and validity of their results, and allows detecting patients at risk or nutritional alert without lead to increased costs.",

METHODS: A prospective study was designed, including 198 consecutive singleton pregnancies between 27 and 41 weeks' gestation. In the study population, 144 had normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, 37 had unilateral pathologic waveforms, and 17 had bilateral pathologic waveforms. Eighty patients had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia toxemia, or both, and 118 had no complications and served as a control group. The uterine artery Doppler waveform was considered abnormal when a notch or pulsatility index above the 90th percentile was noted. RESULTS: In patients with bilateral pathologic uterine artery Doppler waveforms, the rates of cesarean delivery, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates, preterm delivery, and low Apgar scores were increased compared to patients with normal or pathologic unilateral waveforms (P = .009; P > .001; P = .007; P > .001, respectively). The incidence rates for SGA neonates, cesarean delivery, and preterm delivery were significantly higher among patients without IUGR or preeclampsia toxemia when associated with pathologic bilateral waveforms in comparison to normal waveforms (P = .01 for all). A bilateral pathologic waveform was found to be an independent risk factor for cesarean delivery and SGA neonates. The incidence rates for SGA neonates and preterm delivery were significantly higher among patients with IUGR and/or preeclampsia toxemia when associated with bilateral abnormalities in comparison to normal waveforms (P = .01 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Third-trimester abnormal uterine artery Doppler findings are associated with worse perinatal outcomes among patients both with and without pregnancy complications.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The optimal number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) cycles for resectable colorectal liver oligometastases (CLOM) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal number of NAC cycles. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients were included in this study. X-tile analysis was implemented to investigate the optimal cut-off point for NAC cycles. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce selection bias. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox risk regression models were used to analyse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The optimal cut-off point for NAC cycles was 5. There were no significant differences in R0 resection, pathological response or postoperative complications between the groups with a low number of NAC cycles group (\u22645 cycles, n=80) and high number of NAC cycles (>5 cycles, n=49). Patients with a high number of NAC cycles were more likely to have NAC toxicity than those with a low number of cycles (87.8% vs. 65.0%, P=0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that >5 NAC cycles was an independent predictor of reduced PFS (HR =1.808, 95% CI: 1.205-2.712, P=0.004) and reduced OS (HR =1.723, 95% CI: 1.041-2.851, P=0.034). In the oxaliplatin-based regimen group, patients with a low number of NAC cycles had a better PFS (P<0.001, mPFS: 14.7 vs. 5.4 months) and better OS (P=0.018, mOS: 57.7 months vs. 41.0 months) than those with a high number of cycles. After 1:1 propensity matching (34 cases vs. 34 cases), multivariate analysis revealed that >5 NAC cycles was an independent predictor of reduced PFS (HR =2.265, 95% CI: 1.281-4.007, P=0.005) and reduced OS (HR =2.813, 95% CI: 1.359-5.822, P=0.005). In the oxaliplatin-based regimen group, patients with a low number of NAC cycles had better PFS (P<0.001, mPFS: 17.5 vs. 5.6 months) and better OS (P=0.008, mOS: 59.0 vs. 31.8 months) than those with a high number of cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than 5 NAC cycles was optimal for biologically resectable CLOM patients. Giving more than 5 NAC cycles was unnecessary because a higher number of NAC cycles has more unfavourable survival and higher NAC toxicities, while leading to similar R0 resection rates and pathological responses.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common pediatric bone tumor with a high rate of metastasis, high recurrence, and low survival rate. Therefore, the identification of new biomarkers which can improve the prognosis of ES patients is urgently needed. METHODS: Here, GSE17679 dataset was downloaded from GEO databases. WGCNA method was used to identify one module associating with OVS (overall vital survival) and event. cytoHubba was used to screen out 50 hub genes from the module genes. Then, GSE17679 dataset was randomly divided into train cohort and test cohort. Next, univariate Cox analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis were conducted on 50 hub genes combined with train cohort data to select pivotal genes. Finally, an optimal 7-gene-based risk assessment model was established, which was verified by test cohort, entire GSE17679, and two independent datasets (GSE63157 and TCGA-SARC). RESULTS: The results of the functional enrichment analysis revealed that the OVS and event-associated module were mainly enriched in the protein transcription, cell proliferation, and cell-cycle control. And the train cohort was divided into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on the median risk score; the results showed that the survival of the low-risk subgroup was significantly longer than high-risk. ROC analysis revealed that AUC values of 1, 3, and 5-year survival were 0.85, 0.94, and 0.88, and Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed that P value < 0.0001, indicating that this model was accurate, which was also verified in the test, entire cohort, and two independent datasets (GSE63157 and TCGA-SARC). Then, we performed a comprehensive analysis (differential expression analysis, correlation analysis and survival analysis) of seven pivotal genes, and found that four genes (NCAPG, KIF4A, NUF2 and CDC20) plays a more crucial role in the prognosis of ES. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study established an optimal 7-gene-based risk assessment model and identified 4 potential therapeutic targets, to improve the prognosis of ES patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotics with anaerobic coverage are widely used for the treatment of biliary tract infection (BTI), even in the absence of isolated anaerobes. The current study aimed to investigate the differences in clinical outcomes in patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobic bacteremia, treated with vs. without anti-anaerobic coverage. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted at a medical center in Taiwan from September 2014 to March 2016. Patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobic bacteremia and who were treated with appropriate antibiotics were analyzed. The clinical outcomes were compared between patients treated with and without anti-anaerobic coverage as definitive therapy after the blood culture reports were available. Multivariable and propensity score-adjusted analysis were used to identify the risk factors associated with treatment failure. RESULTS: Among the enrolled 87 patients, 63 and 24 patients were treated with and without anaerobic coverage, respectively. Escherichia coli (55.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.0%) were the most common organisms isolated from the blood cultures. The rate of treatment failure (relapse and 28-day mortality) was similar between the groups with and without anaerobic coverage (20.6% vs. 16.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.677). Propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis revealed that definitive therapy without anaerobic coverage was not a predisposing factor for treatment failure (OR\u2009=\u20090.92, 95% CI 0.18-4.67, p\u2009=\u20090.916). CONCLUSIONS: Definitive therapy without anaerobic coverage does not affect the outcomes of patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobes isolated from blood. Our results might provide a possible target for antibiotic stewardship interventions in BTIs.",

METHODS: We evaluated men with Gleason 7 (Grade Groups 2 and 3) prostate cancer treated with dose escalated external beam radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation. We reviewed biopsies for the presence of cribriform pattern and/or intraductal carcinoma. Study end points included biochemical recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free and disease specific survival. RESULTS: In the 237 patients median followup was 117 months (range 3 to 236). According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae risk groups 24% of patients were at favorable intermediate risk, 53% were at unfavorable intermediate risk and 23% were at high risk. The rate of cribriform pattern without intraductal carcinoma, cribriform pattern with intraductal carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma without cribriform pattern and none of these morphologies was 36%, 13%, 0% and 51%, respectively. On multivariable analysis cribriform pattern with intraductal carcinoma (HR 4.22, 95% CI 2.08-8.53, p <0.0001), prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.03-3.79, p=0.04) and prostate specific antigen greater than 20 ng/ml (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.21-4.23, p=0.01) were associated with worse biochemical recurrence-free survival. On multivariable analysis only cribriform pattern with intraductal carcinoma was associated with inferior distant metastasis-free survival (HR 4.18, 95% CI 1.43-12.28, p=0.01) and disease specific survival (HR 14.26, 95% CI 2.75-74.04, p=0.0016). Factors associated with cribriform pattern with or without intraductal carcinoma included Grade Group 3, high risk group and 50% or more positive biopsy cores. When stratified by neither morphology present, cribriform pattern without intraductal carcinoma and cribriform pattern with intraductal carcinoma the differences in biochemical recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free and disease specific survival were statistically significant (p=0.00042, p=0.017 and p <0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cribriform pattern with intraductal carcinoma was associated with adverse outcomes in men with Gleason 7 prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy while cribriform pattern without intraductal carcinoma was not so associated.

Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to assess treatment progress for the whole patient group, for high and low risk patients, and for patients who had been in treatment for a period longer and shorter than one year. Latent Class Analysis has not reconfirmed the previously found profiles, therefore a repeated measures ANOVA was not conducted on profile level. On group-level, no significant progress was found. Though, patients with low protective behaviour, low resocialization scores, and high problem behaviour scores displayed significant treatment progress. Patients with low problematic behaviour showed a significant increase of problematic behaviour and patients with high protective behaviour a decrease of protective behaviour. Results indicated an interaction effect between time of admission and the factor resocialization skills, however this effect was not found for the other two factors.

Skin colonization at the insertion site (defined by quantitative skin cultures performed at the time of insertion and in days 2 and 5) was used as a primary endpoint. Catheter tip colonization was also assessed through qualitative culture and CVC related sepsis was defined by the isolation of the same organism from the catheter tip and the blood, with clinical sepsis of no other apparent source. METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients were enrolled, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU, aged 72+/-12 years, 58% male, SAPS II 42+/-13. One-hundred and seven CVCs were studied (presenting 750 catheter in situ days); CVCs were in place for a mean period of 6.9+/-4.7 days and 5 episodes of central catheter-related bloodstream infection were detected (6.6 per 1000 catheter days). RESULTS: A multiple logistic regression detected an increased risk of skin colonization in male gender (OR=2.5) and control precautions (OR=3.4) and no difference with regard to age, dressing and diagnostic group. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal sterile barrier proved to be an effective and recommended practice.

        "a": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent studies indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are interconnected syndromes. Although the majority of patients who suffer an episode of AKI will recover laboratory indices suggesting complete or near complete recovery of renal function, a significant portion of post-AKI survivors will develop major kidney events, including development of late-stage CKD, need for renal replacement therapies, and death. RECENT FINDINGS: Our review highlights epidemiology of adverse post-AKI events, association of AKI with late development of nonrenal adverse outcomes, use of bedside equations that facilitate prognostication of adverse renal outcomes of AKI, and how variability in serum creatinine values in individual patients, even among those with normal baseline renal function may indicate risk for the development of CKD. Use of common laboratory parameters such as serum creatinine and albumin, along with certain clinical and demographic markers, individualize patients at high risk of complications and in need of close postdischarge follow-up. Evidence that 'organ crosstalk' following a major AKI episode may increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, and hypertension, places its survivors in a special patient category deserving active efforts to minimize risk for cardiovascular events. SUMMARY: AKI is a major cause for acute in-hospital mortality and development of both late-stage CKD and cardiovascular events. Perioperative care to prevent AKI must challenge the notion that a single normal point of contact serum creatinine value substantially reduces the likelihood of its occurrence.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The management of Spetzler-Martin grade (SMG) III brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) may be challenging, whatever the exclusion treatment modality chosen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment (EVT) as a first-line treatment of SMG III bAVMs. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective, two-center, observational cohort study. Cases recorded in institutional databases between January 1998 and June 2021 were reviewed. Patients who were \u2265 18 years of age, had ruptured or unruptured SMG III bAVMs, and received EVT as first-line therapy were included. Baseline characteristics of patients and bAVMs, procedure-related complications, clinical outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale, and angiographic follow-up were assessed. The independent risk factors of procedure-related complications and poor clinical outcome were assessed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients with 116 SMG III bAVMs were included. The mean age of the patients was 41.9 \u00b1 14.0 years. The most common presentation was hemorrhage (66.4%). Forty-nine (42.2%) bAVMs were found to be completely obliterated by EVT alone at follow-up. Complications occurred in 39 patients (33.6%), including 5 (4.3%) major procedure-related complications. There was no independent predictor of procedure-related complication. Age > 40 years and poor preoperative modified Rankin Scale score were the independent predictors of poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: EVT of SMG III bAVMs provides encouraging results but needs further improvement. When the embolization procedure performed with intent to cure appears difficult and/or risky, a combined technique (with microsurgery or radiosurgery) may be a safer and more effective strategy. In terms of safety and effectiveness, the benefit of EVT (alone or included in a multimodal management strategy) for SMG III bAVMs needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials.",

        "a": "In the last decades, understanding of genetic variants contributing to liver disease development has considerably improved through novel genotyping techniques. Genetic variants of single genes are known to be decisive for the development of monogenetic liver diseases of varying severity. Identification of genetic variants is an important part of the diagnostic process, e.\u200ag. the majority of patients with high iron [Fe] (HFE)-associated hemochromatosis carry the homozygous mutation p.C282Y. Detection of mutations in genes encoding hepatobiliary transport proteins like familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1), bile salt export pump (BSEP), or multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) is the basis to differentiate various forms of intrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, genetic variants in a variety of genes are known to act as disease modifiers and represent risk factors for disease progression and the development of cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma. Success of drug treatment or appearance of severe side effects can also be influenced by specific genetic variants. All these aspects underscore the increasing importance of genetic variants, which in the future may help to identify patients at risk for disease progression or help to guide treatment decisions. In the present overview, specific frequent genetic variants are summarized that play roles in monogenetic liver diseases, forms of intrahepatic cholestasis, gallstone development, fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, and liver disease progression as well as hepatocellular carcinoma development.",

        "a": "AIMS: The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score is a modification of the CHADS(2) score that aims to improve stroke risk prediction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) by adding three risk factors: age 65-74, female sex, and history of vascular disease. Whereas previous evaluations of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score included all AF patients, the aim of this analysis was to evaluate its discriminative ability only in those patients for whom recommendations on antithrombotic treatment are uncertain (i.e. CHADS(2) score of 1). METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected all patients with a CHADS(2) score of 1 from the AVERROES and ACTIVE trials who were treated with acetylsalicylic acid with or without clopidogrel and calculated the incidences of ischaemic or unspecified stroke or systemic embolus (SSE) according to their CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. Of 4670 patients with a baseline CHADS(2) score of 1, 26% had a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 and 74% had a score of \u2265 2. After 11 414 patient-years of follow-up, the annual incidence of SSE was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.6-1.3) and 2.1% (95% CI: 1.8-2.5) for patients with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 and \u2265 2, respectively. The c-statistic of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score was 0.587 (95% CI: 0.550-0.624). Age 65 to <75 years was the strongest of the three new risk factors in the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. CONCLUSION: The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score reclassifies 26% of patients with a CHADS(2) score of 1 to a low annual risk of SSE of 1%. This risk seems low enough to consider withholding anticoagulant treatment.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: We aimed to validate a previously described genetic risk score, denoted the cell-cycle progression (CCP) score, in predicting contemporary radical prostatectomy (RP) outcomes. METHODS: RNA was quantified from paraffin-embedded RP specimens. The CCP score was calculated as average expression of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeper genes. Recurrence was defined as two prostate-specific antigen levels \u2265 0.2 ng/mL or any salvage treatment. Associations between CCP score and recurrence were examined, with adjustment for clinical and pathologic variables using Cox proportional hazards regression and partial likelihood ratio tests. The CCP score was assessed for independent prognostic utility beyond a standard postoperative risk assessment (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical [CAPRA-S] score), and a score combining CAPRA-S and CCP was validated. RESULTS: Eighty-two (19.9%) of 413 men experienced recurrence. The hazard ratio (HR) for each unit increase in CCP score (range, -1.62 to 2.16) was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.9); with adjustment for CAPRA-S, the HR was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4). The score was able to substratify patients with low clinical risk as defined by CAPRA-S \u2264 2 (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7). Combining the CCP and CAPRA-S improved the concordance index for both the overall cohort and low-risk subset; the combined CAPRA-S + CCP score consistently predicted outcomes across the range of clinical risk. This combined score outperformed both individual scores on decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION: The CCP score was validated to have significant prognostic accuracy after controlling for all available clinical and pathologic data. The score may improve accuracy of risk stratification for men with clinically localized prostate cancer, including those with low-risk disease.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Decline in eGFR is a biologically plausible surrogate end point for the progression of CKD in clinical trials. However, it must first be tested to ensure strong associations with clinical outcomes in diverse populations, including patients with higher eGFR. METHODS: To investigate the association between 1-, 2-, and 3-year changes in eGFR (slope) with clinical outcomes over the long term, we conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 3,758,551 participants with baseline eGFR\u226560 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 122,664 participants with eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 from 14 cohorts followed for an average of 4.2 years. RESULTS: Slower eGFR decline by 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year over 2 years was associated with lower risk of ESKD in participants with baseline eGFR\u226560 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.72) and eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (0.71; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.74). The relationship was stronger with 3-year slope. For a rapidly progressing population with predicted 5-year risk of ESKD of 8.3%, an intervention that reduced eGFR decline by 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year over 2 years would reduce the ESKD risk by 1.6%. For a hypothetical low-risk population with a predicted 5-year ESKD risk of 0.58%, the same intervention would reduce the risk by only 0.13%. CONCLUSIONS: Slower decline in eGFR was associated with lower risk of subsequent ESKD, even in participants with eGFR\u226560 ml/min per 1.73 m2, but those with the highest risk would be expected to benefit the most.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: There is no consensus as to the optimal treatment paradigm for patients presenting with hemorrhage from severe pelvic fracture. This study was established to determine the methods of hemorrhage control currently being used in clinical practice. METHODS: This prospective, observational multi-center study enrolled patients with pelvic fracture from blunt trauma. Demographic data, admission vital signs, presence of shock on admission (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or heart rate > 120 beats per minute or base deficit < -5), method of hemorrhage control, transfusion requirements, and outcome were collected. RESULTS: A total of 1,339 patients with pelvic fracture were enrolled from 11 Level I trauma centers. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were male, with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 47.1 \u00b1 21.6 years, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 19.2 \u00b1 12.7. In-hospital mortality was 9.0 %. Angioembolization and external fixator placement were the most common method of hemorrhage control used. A total of 128 patients (9.6%) underwent diagnostic angiography with contrast extravasation noted in 63 patients. Therapeutic angioembolization was performed on 79 patients (5.9%). There were 178 patients (13.3%) with pelvic fracture admitted in shock with a mean \u00b1 SD ISS of 28.2 \u00b1 14.1. In the shock group, 44 patients (24.7%) underwent angiography to diagnose a pelvic source of bleeding with contrast extravasation found in 27 patients. Thirty patients (16.9%) were treated with therapeutic angioembolization. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta was performed on five patients in shock and used by only one of the participating centers. Mortality was 32.0% for patients with pelvic fracture admitted in shock. CONCLUSION: Patients with pelvic fracture admitted in shock have high mortality. Several methods were used for hemorrhage control with significant variation across institutions. The use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta may prove to be an important adjunct in the treatment of patients with severe pelvic fracture in shock; however, it is in the early stages of evaluation and not currently used widely across trauma centers.

Methods: In this study, we presented gender, age, urbanization, occupation and, comorbidities in a RA cohort and a non-RA cohort based on number and percentage. We investigated the OA risk in patients with RA. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a 13-year longitudinal follow-up in Taiwan. Patients who received RA diagnoses between 2000 and 2012 were enrolled in the study cohort. The non-RA cohort were 1:1 propensity score matched with the RA cohort by age, gender, index year, urbanization, occupation, and comorbidities. The hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated after confounders were adjusted. Sensitivity analysis utilizing the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) was conducted. Results: We totally enrolled 63,626 cases in RA patients (study cohort) and matched controls. In the RA cohort, the crude HR for OA was 2.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.63-3.11, p < 0.001), and the aHR was 2.75 (95% CI, 2.52-2.99, p < 0.001). (The study demonstrated that patients with RA had a higher risk for developing OA compared with the non-RA controls.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 2928 intermediate-risk PCa patients according to the D'Amico classification undergoing RP and bilateral lymph node dissection in seven academic centres between 2000 and 2011. Pathologically favorable PCa was defined as low-grade organ-confined disease. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained to quantify the overall accuracy (Area Under the Curve, AUC) of the model to predict specimen-confined (SC) disease. Calibration curve was then constructed to illustrate the relationship between the risk-estimates obtained by the model and the observed proportion of SC disease. Kaplan-Meier method was used for PSA recurrence-free survival (PSA-RFS) assessment. RESULTS: Median age was 68 years. 10.6% patients finally presented pathologically favorable disease characteristics at RP. A higher PSAD (OR\u2009=\u20090.01; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.00-0.04; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and percentage of positive cores (OR\u2009=\u20090.97; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.96-0.98; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) were associated with a reduced probability of favorable disease at RP in multivariate analysis. ROC curve analysis showed strongest accuracy of the model (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.79-0.84). Favorable PCa had a significantly better PSA recurrence-free survival rates as compared to unfavorable PCa after RP (94.2% vs 74.4% at 4 years, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This external validation of the Gandaglia nomogram shows relevant accuracy with one out of ten patients in this intermediate risk PCa group with pathologically proven organ-confined disease. This validated risk calculator can help physician to distinguish favorable intermediate risk PCa that can be treated by conservative approach or safer nerve-sparing surgery.",

Potential risk of complications, in particular in fragile patients, is still not negligible. AIM: To describe the technique and outcomes of modified BAV in fragile symptomatic patients unsuitable for other treatments using no-pacing and minimally invasive approach. METHODS: Symptomatic fragile patients with severe aortic valve stenosis judged unsuitable by the heart team for surgical or percutaneous valve implantation from 1 September 2013 to 1 September 2017 were offered modified BAV. Simplified procedural protocol included a 4F right radial artery access for gradient check, a 8F compatible undersized balloons, two partial inflations-trial before a full inflation with no-pace maker back-up, final pressure gradient recording and aortography. RESULTS: Thirty-four symptomatic fragile patients (mean age 80.9\u00b14.9, range 73 to 91years, 100% Katz >6, mean Euroscore I 30.0\u00b111.7%) underwent modified BAV in the last 5years with immediate success in all (100%).

All patients were interviewed with the classification rules for Fine Modified Forecasting to evaluate the adequacy of hospital admissions through the analysis of associated comorbidity, severity parameters and quality indicators. RESULTS: We detected 23 cases (6.07%) of CAP inadequately admitted, 5 of whom were Class I (21.7%), 10 Class II (43.4%) and 8 Class III (34.7%). COPD (32.5%) and hypoxemia (36%) were the comorbidities and risk factors most involved in the admission of low-risk CAP.

This, in turn, means that more transplant recipients will seek musculoskeletal care to treat degenerative joint disease and also trauma incidents. Safety concerns regarding elective and posttraumatic hip arthroplasty in transplant patients include an increased risk of infection, wound healing problems, periprosthetic fractures and loosening of the implants. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and safety aspects were retrospectively reviewed for five primary total hip arthroplasties (THA) in lung transplant recipients with minimal follow-up of two years at average of 2.6 (2-11) years. Patients were recruited from the Zurich Lung Transplant Center comprising of a cohort of 253 patients between January 1st, 2004 and December 31st, 2013. RESULTS: All five patients subjectively reported excellent outcomes after THA with a final average Harris Hip Score of 97 (86-100). One 71-year-old patient died 26\u00a0months after THA unrelated to arthroplasty. One superficial wound healing disturbance was documented. No periprosthetic fractures, no dislocations, no periprosthetic infections, no further revision surgery, no implant loosening was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, THA can be safely and successfully performed even in lung transplant patients under long-term immunosuppressive therapy and polymedication, provided a multidisciplinary approach can be granted.",

We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24\u2009h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases. We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios. In a case study of a particular prediction, we demonstrate that neural networks can be used to identify relevant information from the patient's chart.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and acute renal failure (ARF) in critically ill patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, observational study in a general intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Patients consecutively admitted for >24 h during a 6-month period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was measured through the urinary bladder pressure measurement method. The IAH was defined as a IAP > or =12 mmHg in at least two consecutive measurements performed at 24-h intervals. The ARF was defined as the failure class of the RIFLE classification. Of 123 patients, 37 (30.1%) developed IAH. Twenty-three patients developed ARF (with an overall incidence of 19%), 16 (43.2%) in IAH and 7 (8.1%) in non-IAH group (p<0.05). Shock (p<0.001), IAH (p=0.002) and low abdominal perfusion pressure (APP; p=0.046) resulted as the best predictive factors for ARF. The optimum cut-off point of IAP for ARF development was 12 mmHg, with a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 67%. The best cut-off values of APP and filtration gradient (FG) for ARF development were 52 and 38 mmHg, respectively. Age(p=0.002), cumulative fluid balance (p=0.002) and shock (p=0.006) were independent predictive factors of IAH. Raw hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with IAH; however, risk-adjusted and O/E ratio mortality rates were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients IAH is an independent predictive factor of ARF at IAP levels as low as 12 mmHg, although the contribution of impaired systemic haemodynamics should also be considered.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leaks (AL) contribute to postoperative mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and increased health care costs. While left-sided AL (LAL) are well described in the literature, there is a paucity of studies on outcomes and management of right-sided AL (RAL). This study aimed to compare the timing of RAL versus LAL, and the variable diagnosis, management and outcomes of RAL versus LAL. We hypothesized that the timing of RAL may be later compared to LAL and may result in worse overall outcomes. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative intent surgery for neoplastic disease from January 1995 to December 2015 were included. Patients that underwent an anastomosis below the peritoneal reflection, neoadjuvant treatment, fecal diversion, previous colectomy/anastomosis, multiple anastomoses, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease or hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes were excluded. Patient demographics, neoplastic data, operative data, time to AL, methods utilized for diagnosis of AL, and management of AL were collected. The primary endpoint was timing of AL, and secondary endpoints were management and outcome based on RAL versus LAL. RAL and LAL were analyzed and compared using Chi-squared and categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and continuous variables expressed as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: A total of 2223 patients underwent oncologic resection for colonic neoplasia (1457 right sided and 766 left sided anastomoses). 67% of patients were male and median age was 69 years (range, 34-91). There were 48 total AL events (2.16%): 26 RAL (1.78%) and 22 LAL (2.87%). There was no statistical difference in leak rates between RAL and LAL and no difference in time to diagnosis or management (Table 1). RAL had significantly decreased operative time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), decreased intraoperative blood loss (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and increased diagnosis by CT/plain radiograph (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). All patients that underwent surgery for leak had some form of fecal diversion performed. Morbidity and mortality were comparable between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.70; p\u00a0=\u00a01.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study found overall very low AL rates with comparable timing of RAL and LAL, and no difference in management or outcome of RAL vs. LAL. These findings are informative for patient and surgeon expectations before and after surgery and when AL is suspected.",

        "a": "Coronary artery disease has been reported in more than 50% of patients with severe aortic stenosis above the age of 70 years. Combined surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with a higher operative risk. Concomitant coronary artery disease also increases the procedural risk of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and hence, a combined strategy for treating both entities needs to be carefully considered. Data regarding TAVI and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a combined percutaneous procedure are scarce. We report the case of an 84-year-old woman who presented with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and impending pulmonary edema who was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and two-vessel coronary artery disease. Because of an elevated logistic Euroscore of 25% and her unstable presentation, percutaneous coronary revascularization and TAVI were successfully performed in a combined percutaneous transfemoral procedure. She had a smooth recovery and rehabilitation period with significant improvement in her symptoms and functional capacity. Thirty-day follow-up, including transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, showed a well-functioning prosthetic valve and no signs of residual myocardial ischemia. We therefore conclude that combined PCI and TAVI is feasible and can be associated with good clinical outcomes in selected cases. Further data and experience are needed to evaluate this strategy.",

        "a": "AIMS: Ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW), is an emerging diagnostic tool, which has been used in both males\u00a0and females with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The currently acknowledged UEBW calculation methods rely on the accurate\u00a0measurement of bladder wall thickness (BWT). We aim to identify if subtle errors in BWT measurement have a significant\u00a0impact on UEBW calculations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomly selected from an overactive bladder\u00a0patient cohort. The primary endpoint was to identify the range of false BWT measurements outside which significant changes\u00a0in UEBW calculation occur. We used the Kojima method and a semi-automatic 3-D model that is based on Chalana's principle. Measurements were performed using the correct BWT and a series of faulty calculations from +0.5 mm to -0.5 mm using steps\u00a0of 0.05 mm from true BWT. The effect of a fixed 0.5 mm BWT error was checked in bladder volumes above and below 250 ml\u00a0and in three UEBW groups (<35 gr; 36-50 gr; >51gr). RESULTS: BWT measurement errors above 0.25 mm cause statistically significant changes in UEWB calculation when a 3-D model is used and errors above 0.15 mm when Kojima's method is used.\u00a0At a fixed BWT error of 0.5 mm and bladder volume <250 ml, there is a 23.76% deviation from true UEBW, while at volumes\u00a0>250 ml the deviation is 32.72%. The deviation is inversely proportional to the UEBW result, and heavier bladders deviate\u00a0less. CONCLUSIONS: UEBW is a promising diagnostic tool, but small errors in BWT measurement might cause significant deviation\u00a0from the true values. A 3-D calculation model appears to minimize such risks.",

METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies in Women Living with HIV (WLH) between\u00a02006 and\u00a02019. Patient charts were revised, and maternal characteristics, type of HIV infection (perinatal vs. behavioral), Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) exposure, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were assessed. The HIV-related aspects considered were: Viral Load (VL), CD4+ cell count, opportunistic infections, and genotype testing.

We conducted a prospective randomized control trial to compare the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine with propofol for patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute stroke. METHODS: A total of 80 patients who met study inclusion criteria were received either propofol (n\u200a=\u200a45) or dexmedetomidine (n\u200a=\u200a35) between January 2016 and August 2018. We recorded the favorable neurologic outcome (modified Rankin score <3) both at discharge and 3 months after stroke, National Institute of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS) at 48\u200ahours post intervention, modified thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score on digital subtraction angiography, intraprocedural hemodynamics, recovery time, relevant time intervals, satisfaction score of the surgeon, mortality, and complications. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups (P\u200a>\u200a.05) with respect to heart rate, respiratory rate, and SPO2 during the procedure. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly low in the propofol group until 15\u200aminutes after anesthesia was induced. No difference was recorded between the groups at the incidence of fall in MAP >20%, MAP >40% and time spent with MAP fall >20% from baseline MAP. In the propofol group, the time spent with MAP fall >40% from baseline MAP was significantly long (P\u200a<\u200a.05). Midazolam and fentanyl were similar between the 2 groups (P\u200a>\u200a.05) that used vasoactive drugs. The time interval from stroke onset to CT room, from stroke onset to groin puncture, and from stroke onset to recanalization/end of the procedure, was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P\u200a>\u200a.05). The recovery time was longer in the dexmedetomidine group (P\u200a<\u200a.05). There was no difference between the groups with respect to complications, favorable neurological outcome, and mortality both at hospital discharge and 3 months later, successful recanalization and NIHSS score after 48\u200ahours (P\u200a>\u200a.05). However, the satisfaction score of the surgeon was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (P\u200a<\u200a.05).

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of GPA patients who received similar biologic of rituximab as either remission induction or maintenance agent. Demographic parameters, Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS-v3), vasculitis damage index, relapse and adverse events were retrieved from patient records. Outcomes noted were remission at 6\u00a0months in remission induction group and rates of relapses, adverse events, serious infections and mortality in both remission induction and maintenance groups. RESULTS: Seventy-seven GPA patients were enrolled. Sixty received rituximab for induction and 57 for maintenance; 69% were anti PR-3 positive. In the induction group, median BVAS-v3 reduced from 12 (IQR 6-21.5) to 0 (0-1) at 6\u00a0months. At 6\u00a0months, 60% patients attained remission, 40% in primary induction group and 74% in re-induction group (p\u2009=\u20090.016%). In the maintenance group, seven (12%) patients had relapses with median time to relapse of 12 (6-22) months. Median relapse free survival was 21 (6-22) months on rituximab maintenance.

PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients referred for coronary angiography. MEASUREMENTS: Socio-demographic data (age, education level, and occupation), cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and family history of coronary artery disease), and egg-eating habits were assessed using a research questionnaire. Egg consumption was divided into three categories: less than one egg a week; one egg a week; and more than one egg a week. Coronary atherosclerotic burden was assessed by a blinded interventional cardiologist using the Friesinger Score (FS) obtained from the coronary angiography. This score varies from 0 to 15 and evaluated each of the three main coronary arteries separately. For this analysis, the FS was divided into three categories: 0-4, 5-9, and 10-15. RESULTS: The study sample was composed of 382 adult patients; 241 patients (63.3%) were male. The average age was 60.3 \u00b1 10.8 years (range 23-89 years). The egg-eating category was inversely associated with dyslipidemia (p < 0.05) but not with the other cardiovascular risk factors. A significant association was found between egg consumption and FS (p < 0.05), showing that patients who ate more than one egg a week had a lower coronary atherosclerotic burden. By multivariate analysis, the atherosclerotic burden was independently associated with sex, age, hypertension and egg consumption.

Frequency of immediate (during or immediately after the procedure) or delayed (within 24 - 72 hours following the procedure) adverse events. SETTING: Tertiary, academic, outpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation interventional spine clinic. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one patients (111 men) underwent 239 procedures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of subject age was 56.4 (16.6) years ranging from 20 to 89. The mean and SD of pre-procedure 11-point Visual Analog Pain Scale was 5.5 (2.2) ranging from 0 to 10, and for post-procedure was 2.6 (2.6) ranging from 0 to 10. Trainees were involved in 52.3% of procedures. Reported immediate adverse events were vasovagal reaction (3.8%, n = 9) and steroid clogged needle (0.4%, n = 1). Follow-up data were available for 185/239 procedures (77.4%). There were 35 adverse events reported at mean follow-up interval of 1.8 days, of which the most frequent were injection site soreness (6.0%, n = 11), pain exacerbation (4.3%, n = 8), sleeplessness (2.2%, n = 4), and transient headache (1.6%, n = 3).

A better understanding of the relationships between health literacy, depressive symptoms, and patient-reported problems in using glaucoma medications may reveal opportunities for intervention that could improve patients' clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between patient characteristics (demographics, health literacy, and depressive symptoms) and patient-reported problems in using glaucoma medications and to assess factors related to patients' self-reported adherence to glaucoma medications. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (n = 228) currently taking intraocular pressure-lowering medications were recruited at 6 ophthalmology clinics. Patients were interviewed to identify problems using glaucoma medications, and self-reported medication adherence was determined using a Visual Analog Scale. Questionnaires were administered to assess health literacy, depressive symptoms, outcome expectations, and medication self-efficacy. RESULTS: Younger patients (P = 0.03), patients with depressive symptoms (P = 0.02), and patients who reported more medication problems (P = 0.005) were significantly less adherent to their glaucoma medications. Patients with higher glaucoma medication self-efficacy adherence scores (P = 0.003) and higher outcome expectations (P = 0.03) were significantly more adherent. CONCLUSIONS: Providers should consider using tools to screen glaucoma patients for depressive symptoms and for problems in using medications to identify patients who are at higher risk of nonadherence to treatment and who might benefit from follow-up with primary care providers.",

No published reports have described clinical pharmacist impact aimed at mitigating inappropriate albumin use in the ICU. Objective: To evaluate the clinical and economic impact of a clinical pharmacist-led intervention strategy targeting inappropriate albumin in the ICU. Methods: A retrospective cohort study evaluated all adult (\u226518 years) ICU patients administered albumin at an academic medical center over a 2-year period. Institutional guidelines were developed with clinical pharmacists targeting inappropriate albumin use. The primary end point was to compare inappropriate use of albumin administered before and after pharmacist intervention implementation. Secondary analyses compared the overall albumin use between study periods. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and albumin-related costs between study periods were also compared. Results: A total of 4419 patients were identified, with 2448 (55.4%) critically ill patients included. The pharmacist-led strategy resulted in a 50.9% reduction of inappropriate albumin use (P < 0.001). The rate of inappropriate albumin use was 44.3 \u00b1 10.5 and 5.5 \u00b1 2.9 g per patient-day in the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, respectively (P < 0.001). Costs associated with overall and inappropriate albumin use in the ICU decreased by 34.8% and 87.1%, respectively. Total annual cost-savings was $355\u2009393 in the ICUs. No differences in clinical outcomes were found. Conclusion and Relevance: Clinical pharmacist-led interventions reduced overall and inappropriate albumin use and costs without negatively affecting clinical outcomes.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The intention of this study was to analyze the long-term results of the proximal closing wedge osteotomy for the correction of hallux valgus deformity, modified by adding a mini L-plate for osteosynthesis. METHODS: The outcome of a proximal first metatarsal closing wedge osteotomy was retrospectively evaluated after a mean follow-up of 52 months. A total of 66 female patients (86 feet) participated in this study. The AOFAS-score was used to evaluate the postoperative results. Pre- and postoperative weight-bearing radiographs were used to evaluate the osseous development. RESULTS: 95.5% of the patients were satisfied, 3 patients (4.5%) were not satisfied with the overall result of the operation. Transfer metatarsalgia was registered in 7 of 50 cases. The mean improvement of the HV-angle was 22.1 degrees (36.4 degrees to 14.3 degrees ) and the intermetatarsal angle was reduced from a mean of 17.6 degrees to a mean of 6.5 degrees . The mean first metatarsal shortening was 3.2mm. The mean AOFAS-score was 78 points. CONCLUSION: The results confirm, that the closing wedge osteotomy is indicated for moderate to severe hallux valgus. The shortening of the first ray is comparable with other well-established operative procedures. The risk of transfer metatarsalgia can only be lightly reduced by this procedure.",

We sought to delineate the differences between community-associated (CA)- and HCA-APN with specific interest in antibiotic resistance of causative microorganisms. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study during a 1-y period at a large referral center. Patients who visited the emergency department with symptoms and signs of APN were included in the study population. RESULTS: Among 319 cases with community-onset APN, 201 cases (63%) were classified as HCA-APN. Patients with HCA-APN had higher SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) scores, longer length of hospital stay and a lower rate of complete response to antimicrobial therapy. Patients with complicated APN also had characteristics similar to those seen in HCA-APN. However, 14-day mortality rates were not different between CA-APN vs HCA-APN and between uncomplicated APN vs complicated APN. With regard to microbiological characteristics, Escherichia coli were less common in HCA-APN than in CA-APN (62.7% vs 93.2%, p < 0.001). Among E. coli isolates, quinolone resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were more common in HCA-APN than in CA-APN (38.9% vs 12.7%, p < 0.001; 15.9% vs 0.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: HCA-APN, and complicated APN, represents a distinct subset of urinary tract infections with more antibiotic-resistant pathogens and worse outcomes, which physicians should consider to provide optimal treatment.",

We compared the clinical and angiographic characteristics and procedural outcomes of patients who underwent treatment of single versus >1 CTOs during the same procedure in 20 centers from the United States, Europe, and Russia. A total of 2,955 patients were included: mean age was 65 \u00b1 10\u00a0years and 85% were men with high prevalence of previous myocardial infarction (46%), and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (33%). More than one CTO lesions were attempted during the same procedure in 58 patients (2.0%) and 70% of them were located in different major epicardial arteries. Compared with patients who underwent PCI of a single CTO, those who underwent PCI of >1 CTOs during the same procedure had similar J-CTO (2.4 \u00b1 1.3 vs 2.5 \u00b1 1.3, p\u202f=\u202f0.579) and Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (1.5 \u00b1 1.2 vs 1.3 \u00b1 1.0 p\u202f=\u202f0.147) scores.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study after the implementation of the cardiac surgical safety checklist in a reference hospital in Latin America. All patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and/or heart valve surgery from\u00a02013 to\u00a02019 were analyzed. After the implementation of the project InCor-Checklist \"Five steps to safe cardiac surgery\" in\u00a02015, the correlation between adherence and completeness of this instrument with surgical mortality was assessed. The EuroSCORE\u00a0II was used as a reference to assess the risk of expected mortality for patients. Cross-sectional questionnaires were during the implementation of the InCor-Checklist. To perform the correlation, Pearson's coefficient was calculated using R software. RESULTS: Since\u00a02013, data from\u00a08139\u00a0patients have been analyzed. The average annual mortality was\u00a05.98%. In\u00a02015, the instrument was used in only\u00a058% of patients; in contrast, it was used in\u00a0100% of patients in\u00a02019. There was a decrease in surgical mortality from\u00a08.22% to\u00a03.13% for the same group of procedures. The results indicate that the greater the checklist use, the lower the surgical mortality (r\u00a0=\u00a088.9%). In addition, the greater the InCor-Checklist completeness, the lower the surgical mortality (r\u00a0=\u00a094.1%).

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast enhancement of the oculomotor nerve in MRI was recently noticed in patients with clinical ischemic isolated oculomotor nerve palsy (iIONP). The opinions about whether this is a sign of inflammation and whether or not to administer steroids vary between doctors. The study aimed to determine the associations between this enhancement and vascular-disease risk factors (VRFs) and inflammatory factors in iIONP patients. METHODS: The study recruited patients who had experienced iIONP during the previous 2 years. They were divided into groups A and B based on whether or not they exhibited an enhanced oculomotor nerve in MRI of the cavernous sinus using thin-section, fat-suppressed, and contrast-enhanced sequences. VRFs, inflammatory factors, and improvement scores were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Most (71.1%) of the 45 included iIONP patients had enhanced oculomotor nerves in MRI. VRFs, periorbital pain, elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were not significantly associated with the enhancement. Four of the five patients in group A exhibited an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IgG synthesis rate. The improvement score of eight patients who received 80 mg of methylprednisolone in addition to the routine therapy was not significantly different from the scores of the other patients (p=0.485). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the iIONP patients had an enhanced oculomotor nerve in MRI. A few of them also had elevated CSF IgG synthesis rate, but no further evidence for inflammation was found. The administration of steroids seemed to have no benefit other than increasing the blood glucose level.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing couples are theoretically attractive in total hip arthroplasty (THA) because of low wear, but concerns regarding ceramic fracture and squeaking have arisen. Improved material properties of newer alumina matrix composite (AMC) materials, known as Delta ceramics, may reduce these risks. In addition, the use of thinner liners and larger femoral heads may be helpful clinically to lower the rate of dislocation. However, limited short-term clinical results are available and intermediate-term effects are unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the frequency of bearing-related complications (dissociation, fracture, and noise) with ceramic-on-ceramic AMC bearings in cementless THA? (2) What other complications arose in patients treated with these bearings? (3) What are the Harris hip scores (HHS) and survivorship free from reoperation and revision at a minimum of 5 years after cementless THA performed with AMC bearings? METHODS: Over a 9-month period in 2009, one surgeon performed 125 THAs, of which 100 (80% of the total) were performed with cementless, AMC bearings. During the period in question, the exclusion criteria for this implant were primary THAs with severe acetabular or femoral bone defect and revision THAs. Of these, 94 hips (95%) in 91 patients were available for analysis at a minimum of 5 years (range, 5-6 years), because five patients (six hips) had died. Mean age at the time of arthroplasty was 55 \u00b1 14 years. Prostheses with an identical design and Biolox(\u00ae) Delta ceramics were used in all patients. Noise was classified into squeaking, clicking, grinding, and popping. Ceramic fracture, dislocation, and any other complications associated with the use of AMC ceramics were also investigated. Clinical evaluation included the modified HHS preoperatively and at each followup. Survivorship free from reoperation and revision was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of 91 patients, four developed bearing-related complications, including one with liner dissociation despite initial square seating and three with clicking. No patients had ceramic fractures. A single event of perioperative dislocation occurred in one patient and postoperative periprosthetic fracture occurred in two hips. Mean HHS improved from 56 to 93 points at the final followup (p < 0.001). Survivorship at 5 years free from reoperation and revision was 96.8% and 97.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Improved material properties combined with the possible use of larger diameter heads make AMC ceramics a promising alternative bearing option with seemingly comparable clinical outcomes reported by others with conventional ceramic bearings. Despite these encouraging results, however, meticulous technical precautions such as square seating and proper impaction in particular should be taken during liner insertion, because we did observe one liner dissociation and several patients with hip noises.

In our study we want to compare the surgical margin positivity rates for retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP) and investigate the factors affecting surgical margin positivity in RALP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 78 RRP and 62 RALP patients operated from 2011 May to 2016 March were retrospectively screened. Patients in both groups were compared in terms of age, postop hematocrit reduction, hospital stay, duration of follow-up, surgical margin positivity, biochemical recurrence and oncologic parameters. In RALP group it was searched the relationship between the surgical margin positivity and prostate specific antigen (PSA), positive biopsy core, biopsy Gleason scoring, pathologic stage and Gleason scoring, lymph node positivity, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, prostate weight. RESULTS: Patients in the RALP group had lower postop hematocrit reduction and shorter hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in surgical margin positivity between RALP and RRP groups (37.1% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.341).

The most important mechanisms known to cause resistance are point mutations in the ABL tyrosine kinase and the ATP domain. This study describes the use of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) as a method to screen for mutations of the ABL gene. METHODS: We used the dHPLC based assay for the screening of ABL point mutations. Forty chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who showed resistance to imatinib were screened in parallel by dHPLC and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Nine of the 40 patients (23%) had mutations. CONCLUSION: dHPLC can be a useful method for pre-screening. Analyzing the mutations and monitoring (high-risk) patients can improve their prognosis and survival rate. dHPLC can potentially become a valuable tool for regular testing of patients in the future.",

Pacemaker implantation rates after TAVR appear to be higher compared to conventional aortic valve replacement. The aim of this study was to analyze whether a high annulus implantation conveys the benefit of a decreased rate of permanent pacemaker implantation while being safe and successful according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 (VARC2)-criteria. METHODS: A total of 23 patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis, an aortic annulus of 19-27 mm and at high risk for surgery were treated with the Lotus valve. In all patients the valve was implanted in a high annulus position via femoral access. The primary device performance endpoint was VARC2-defined device success after 30 days and the primary safety endpoint was the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.23 \u00b1 7.65 years, 46% were female, 38% were New York Heart Association class III/IV at baseline. Thirty-day follow-up data were available for all patients. The VARC2-defined device success rate after 30 days was 22/23 (96%). 2/21 (10%) patients required a newly implanted pacemaker due to 3rd degree atrioventricular block. 25% of the patients developed a new left bundle branch block after valvuloplasty or device implantation. 21 of the 23 patients (96%) had no other signs of conduction disturbances after 30 days.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial dysfunction is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We describe the outcome in a small series of Asian Indian patients and examine associated factors. METHODS: SLE patients who fulfilled the 2012 SLICC criteria and developed new-onset myocardial dysfunction were included in this retrospective case series. Acute myocardial dysfunction was defined as global hypokinesia and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)<50% on echocardiography (with or without symptoms) in patients with SLE. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression. RESULTS: This study included 37 patients with mean age 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u00a0years and median (range) LVEF of 35% (18-48%) at presentation. A majority had active disease, with SLEDAI-2k \u2265\u20095 in 26 (of 28). All patients received oral corticosteroids and a majority received additional immunosuppression, including pulse methylprednisolone in 28 and cyclophosphamide in 27. Nine patients died during hospitalisation (25%), a majority due to infections. Death was significantly associated with elevated procalcitonin at presentation (p\u2009=\u20090.05), elevated white cell count (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and low complement C3 (p\u2009=\u20090.03). In those who survived, long-term outcomes were good, with complete myocardial recovery in 14 (64%). A higher ejection fraction at presentation was associated with complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: In this small series of patients of SLE with acute myocardial dysfunction, we report a significant in-hospital mortality due to infections. Many of the patients who died had elevated procalcitonin at presentation. A diligent search for infection seems prudent in lupus patients who present with acute myocardial dysfunction. Key Points \u2022 In patients of SLE with acute myocardial dysfunction who were treated with immunosuppression, there was significant short-term mortality due to infections. \u2022 This mortality was associated with elevated procalcitonin at baseline and may suggest some of them had pre-existing hidden sepsis. \u2022 A prudent search for infections in these patients before immunosuppression may help to decrease short-term mortality.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Ezetimibe improves cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) when added to statin therapy. After ACS, patients vary considerably in their risk for recurrent CV events. OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis that atherothrombotic risk stratification may be useful to identify post-ACS patients who have the greatest potential for benefit from the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy. METHODS: The TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2\u00b0P) is a simple 9-point risk stratification tool, previously developed in a large population with atherothrombosis to predict CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic stroke (CV death/MI/ischemic cerebrovascular accident [iCVA]). The current study applied this tool prospectively to 17,717 post-ACS patients randomized either to ezetimibe and simvastatin or to\u00a0placebo and simvastatin in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial). Treatment efficacy was assessed by baseline risk for CV death/MI/iCVA, the IMPROVE-IT composite endpoints (CE), and\u00a0individual component endpoints at 7 years. RESULTS: All 9 clinical variables in the TRS 2\u00b0P were independent risk indicators for CV death/MI/iCVA (p\u00a0< 0.001). The integer-based scheme showed a strong graded relationship with the rate of CV death/MI/iCVA, the trial CE, and the individual components (p\u00a0trend\u00a0<0.0001 for each). High-risk patients (n\u00a0= 4,393; 25%), defined by\u00a0\u22653 risk indicators, had a 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 2.9% to 9.7%) absolute risk reduction in CV death/MI/iCVA at 7 years with ezetimibe/simvastatin, thus translating to a number-needed-to-treat of 16. Intermediate-risk patients (2 risk indicators; n\u00a0=\u00a05,292; 30%) had a 2.2% (95% confidence interval: -0.3% to 4.6%) absolute risk reduction. Low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk indicators; n\u00a0=\u00a08,032; 45%) did not appear to derive benefit from the addition of ezetimibe (p interaction\u00a0= 0.010). Similar findings were observed for the IMPROVE-IT primary CE.

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes and dysglycemia increase the risk of frailty and decreased physical abilities. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) may reduce this risk. We hypothesized that adherence to the MD is associated with physical function in older type-2 diabetic patients and that the association is stratified by age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited type-2 diabetes patients aged >60 years at the Center for Successful Aging with Diabetes at Sheba Medical Center. Health status and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Food Frequency Questionnaire was used for nutritional assessment and calculation of MD score. Physical function indices were determined by a physiotherapist and included: Berg Balance test, Timed Get-Up-and-Go, 6-min walk (6 MW), 10-m walk (10 MW), Four Square Step Test, 30-s chair stand and Grip strength, and activities and instrumental activities of daily living. Among 117 participants (age 70.6 \u00b1 6.5), high adherence to MD was associated with better score on functional tests (low vs. high MD adherence: 9.7% vs. 25%, ANOVA p = 0.02). A significant age by MD interaction was found: a higher adherence to MD was associated with a better 6 MW (low vs. high: 387 \u00b1 35 m vs. 483 \u00b1 26 m; p = 0.001) and higher 10 MW (low vs. high: 1.8 \u00b1 0.16 m/s vs. 2.0 \u00b1 0.13 m/s; p = 0.02) in participants aged >75 years. These associations remained significant after controlling for gender, age, BMI, and physical activity. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we showed relationships between strength, physical performance, and MD among older diabetic patients.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: There have been several published reports of inflammatory ocular adverse events, mainly uveitis and scleritis, among patients taking oral bisphosphonates. We examined the risk of these adverse events in a pharmacoepidemiologic cohort study. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving residents of British Columbia who had visited an ophthalmologist from 2000 to 2007. Within the cohort, we identified all people who were first-time users of oral bisphosphonates and who were followed to the first inflammatory ocular adverse event, death, termination of insurance or the end of the study period. We defined an inflammatory ocular adverse event as scleritis or uveitis. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to determine the adjusted rate ratios. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed a propensity-score-adjusted analysis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 934,147 people, including 10,827 first-time users of bisphosphonates and 923,320 nonusers. The incidence rate among first-time users was 29/10,000 person-years for uveitis and 63/10,000 person-years for scleritis. In contrast, the incidence among people who did not use oral bisphosphonates was 20/10,000 person-years for uveitis and 36/10,000 for scleritis (number needed to harm: 1100 and 370, respectively). First-time users had an elevated risk of uveitis (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.68) and scleritis (adjusted RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.34-1.68). The rate ratio for the propensity-score-adjusted analysis did not change the results (uveitis: RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.29-1.73; scleritis: RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70). INTERPRETATION: People using oral bisphosphonates for the first time may be at a higher risk of scleritis and uveitis compared to people with no bisphosphonate use. Patients taking bisphosphonates must be familiar with the signs and symptoms of these conditions, so that they can immediately seek assessment by an ophthalmologist.",

We used the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database to evaluate rates of postoperative TCIs, center variability, and to determine whether center approaches to postoperative TCI might be associated with outcomes. Methods and Results Patients <18 years undergoing an index operation (2010-2016) were included. We determined predischarge postoperative TCI rates and used multivariable modeling, adjusting for patient factors and case complexity, to evaluate the association between center risk-adjusted postoperative TCI rates and risk-adjusted outcomes (operative mortality, post-TCI mortality, and failure-to-rescue). Postoperative TCI was performed after 2615/105\u2009742 (2.5%) index operations and after 1443/25\u2009416 (5.7%) highest complexity operations (STAT [Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Mortality Score] Mortality Category 4 and 5). Median (interquartile range) age of patients undergoing TCI was 2.7 (0.2-8.0) months with 43% performed in neonates. There was a wide center variability across the 107 included centers with risk-adjusted rates of postoperative TCI ranging from 0.0% to 8.0% overall and 0.0% to 20.7% for STAT 4 and 5 cases. Postoperative TCI was associated with higher risk-adjusted odds of operative mortality (odds ratio, 4.06; 95% CI, 3.60-4.58). Centers with higher postoperative TCI rates had higher overall operative mortality ( R2=0.23; P=0.02) but did not have higher post-TCI mortality ( P=0.10). There was no correlation between center TCI rates and failure-to-rescue ( P=0.19). Conclusions Patients undergoing postoperative TCI represent a high-risk cohort. Wide center variability suggests the potential for improving outcomes, but further study is necessary to better understand optimal approaches.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) relieves pain by delivering doses of electric current to the dorsal column of the spinal cord and has been found to be most effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Psychological distress is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic pain and has been found to affect the outcome of SCS. Childhood trauma is a risk factor for chronic pain, but has not previously been studied in SCS patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this prospective registry-based study was to investigate the prevalence of 5 domains of childhood trauma (emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse) and their relationship with the outcome of spinal cord stimulation on patients suffering from treatment-resistant chronic pain. METHODS: SCS patients treated at Kuopio University Hospital between 1/1/2015 and 12/31/2016 were sent a survey in the mail, the Trauma and Distress Scale, assessing childhood trauma (n = 43). Neuropathic pain, disability, anxiety, and depression were measured in the patients pre-surgery and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The patients who provided their name on the questionnaire (n = 22) and had suffered from 3 or more domains of trauma were grouped as the high-trauma group (n = 13) and the rest as the low-trauma group (n = 9). RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 40 patients (93%). At least 1 domain of trauma was experienced by 35 (88%) patients, and at least 2 by 24 (60%). The low-trauma group displayed a statistically significant decrease in the mean PainDETECT score from 21.5 before SCS to 16.5 at 12 months post-surgery (Wilk's lambda = 0.297, F(2,9) = 10.6, P = 0.004), contrary to the high- trauma group (Wilk's lambda = 0.904, F(2,6) = 0.3, P = 0.739). LIMITATIONS: Only 22 of the 40 patients provided their name on the questionnaire, which decreased the sample size on follow-up. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to investigate childhood trauma in SCS patients. Patients who had experienced high amounts of childhood trauma did not experience any relief from neuropathic pain 12 months' post-SCS, contrary to the low-trauma group. Childhood trauma might be a factor worth screening in the preoperative evaluation and aftercare of SCS candidates.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: People living with dementia (PwD) admitted in emergency to an acute hospital may be at higher risk of inappropriate care and poorer outcomes including longer hospitalisations and higher risk of emergency re-admission or death. Since 2009 numerous national and local initiatives in England have sought to improve hospital care for PwD. We compared outcomes of emergency admissions for cohorts of patients aged 65+ with and without dementia at three points in time. METHODS: We analysed emergency admissions (EAs) from the Hospital Episodes Statistics datasets for England 2010/11, 2012/13 and 2016/17. Dementia upon admission was based on a diagnosis in the patient's hospital records within the last five years. Outcomes were length of hospital stays (LoS), long stays (> = 15 days), emergency re-admissions (ERAs) and death in hospital or within 30 days post-discharge. A wide range of covariates were taken into account, including patient demographics, pre-existing health and reasons for admission. Hierarchical multivariable regression analysis, applied separately for males and females, estimated group differences adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: We included 178 acute hospitals and 5,580,106 EAs, of which 356,992 (13.9%) were male PwD and 561,349 (18.6%) female PwD. Uncontrolled differences in outcomes between the patient groups were substantial but were considerably reduced after control for covariates. Covariate-adjusted differences in LoS were similar at all time-points and in 2016/17 were 17% (95%CI 15%-18%) and 12% (10%-14%) longer for male and female PwD respectively compared to patients without dementia. Adjusted excess risk of an ERA for PwD reduced over time to 17% (15%-18%) for males and 17% (16%-19%) for females, but principally due to increased ERA rates amongst patients without dementia. Adjusted overall mortality was 30% to 40% higher for PwD of both sexes throughout the time-period; however, adjusted in-hospital rates of mortality differed only slightly between the patient groups, whereas PwD had around double the risk of dying within 30 days of being discharged. CONCLUSION: Over the six-year period, covariate-adjusted hospital LoS, ERA rates and in-hospital mortality rates for PwD were only slightly elevated compared to similar patients without dementia and remaining differences potentially reflect uncontrolled confounding. PwD however, were around twice as likely to die shortly after discharge, the reasons for which require further investigation. Despite being widely used for service evaluation, LoS, ERA and mortality may lack sensitivity to changes in hospital care and support to PwD.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Decipher genomic classifier (GC) has shown to independently prognosticate outcomes in prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to validate the GC in a randomized phase III trial of dose-escalated salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A clinical-grade whole-transcriptome assay was carried out on radical prostatectomy samples obtained from patients enrolled in Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) 09/10, a phase III trial of 350 men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy randomized to 64 Gy versus 70 Gy without concurrent hormonal therapy or pelvic nodal RT. A prespecified statistical plan was developed to assess the impact of the GC on clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was biochemical progression; secondary endpoints were clinical progression and time to hormone therapy. Multivariable analyses adjusted for age, T-category, Gleason score, postradical prostatectomy persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA at randomization, and randomization arm were conducted, accounting for competing risks. RESULTS: The analytic cohort of 226 patients was representative of the overall trial, with a median follow-up of 6.3 years (interquartile range 6.1-7.2 years). The GC (high versus low-intermediate) was independently associated with biochemical progression [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.60; P < 0.001], clinical progression (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.32-3.98; P\u00a0= 0.003), and use of hormone therapy (sHR 2.99, 95% CI 1.55-5.76; P\u00a0= 0.001). GC high patients had a 5-year freedom from biochemical progression of 45% versus 71% for GC low-intermediate. Dose escalation did not benefit the overall cohort, nor patients with lower versus higher GC scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first contemporary randomized controlled trial in patients treated with early SRT without concurrent hormone therapy or pelvic nodal RT that has validated the prognostic utility of the GC. Independent of standard clinicopathologic variables and RT dose, high-GC patients were more than twice as likely than lower-GC patients to experience biochemical and clinical progression and receive of salvage hormone therapy. These data confirm the clinical value of Decipher GC to personalize the use of concurrent systemic therapy in the postoperative salvage setting.",

        "a": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in developing countries. Tripartite motif-59 (TRIM59) a member of the TRIM ubiquitin ligase family, is a surface molecule that regulates biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Previous studies reported that TRIM59 expression was upregulated in human CRC, however, the expression pattern and role of TRIM59 in benign colorectal lesions remain unclear. Sixty patients diagnosed with CRC and 60 patients with benign lesions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, adenoma, and familial adenomatous polyposis) were recruited to the present study. TRIM59 gene expression was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression of TRIM59 protein and p-AKT were determined using, enzyme-linked immunoassay while p53 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Antioxidant/oxidant role of glutathione (GSH)/malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated by colorimetric methods in all of the studied groups. Our results showed upregulated expressions of TRIM59 gene and protein levels in CRC tissues and benign colonic lesions compared to nontumor tissues. Their levels were higher in inflammatory compared to noninflammatory bowel lesions. There were significant interrelations among TRIM59 gene expression, protein levels, tumor, node, metastasis staging, and the presence of metastasis (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses showed that at the cutoff point of 2.5 TRIM59 mRNA expression can discriminate between CRC cases and benign bowel group (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.639, sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity: 41.7%), and between CRC and controls (AUC: 0.962, sensitivity: 90%, specificity: 91.7%).

RESULTS: Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score was independently predicted by SAD (P\u2009<\u20090.01), GFR (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and diabetic history (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Adjusted R2 of the model was 0.178. SAD could be independently predicted by BMI (P\u2009<\u20090.01), diabetic history (P\u2009<\u20090.01), GFR (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and age (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Adjusted R2 of the model was 0.409. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a cutoff SAD value of 16.55\u00a0cm was determined with sensitivity of 63.7%, specificity of 58.3%. CONCLUSION: Elevated SAD is significantly associated with increased Framingham risk score in non-dialysis CKD patients. SAD can be predicted by patients' BMI, diabetic history, renal function and age. Further investigation is needed to explore the potential benefits of central obesity lowering therapy in this patient group.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate if patients with severe heart disease (CHD patients) present more signs of dental infections than patients without heart disease (non-CHD patients), if serum inflammatory markers differ between the groups, and if there is a link between these and the oral health parameters. METHODS: We performed clinical and radiologic dental examinations and collected serum samples of 256 patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart disease (CHD patients) and 250 non-CHD controls. Serum samples were analysed using pertinent methods in the clinical laboratory of the hospital, and the differences in serum biomarkers between CHD patients and non-CHD patients were examined using various statistical methods. A modified dental index (MDI) was constructed and used in the analyses. RESULTS: CHD patients were significantly more likely to be edentulous (34.8% vs. 14.8%) and retain less natural teeth than non-CHD patients (8.6 vs. 17) (P <.001). In CHD patients the remaining teeth and supporting tissues were more often diseased. High MDI scores were significantly associated with CHD status (OR 1.31, CI 1.16-1.48), as was gingivitis (OR 3.37, CI 1.66-6.86), while the presence of deep periodontal pockets was not. Serum C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations and blood erythrocyte sedimentation rates were higher in the CHD group. Also, H. pylori and Chlamydia antibodies were significantly higher in the CHD group. CONCLUSION: CHD patients presented with poorer oral health status than non-CHD patients. Serum inflammatory markers were significantly higher in the CHD patients compared to the non-CHD group. High MDI scores linked with risk of CHD.",

This study investigated the prognostic value of copeptin in the patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 243 consecutive patients were included. Upon admission, plasma copeptin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The end points were mortality and poor functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) after 3\u202fmonths. RESULTS: In 243 patients, 112 (46.1%) were male and median age was 58\u202fyears (IQR 49-68). Median copeptin plasma levels were 21.0\u202fpmol/l (IQR 13.2-31.2). Copeptin levels increased with increasing severity of aSAH as defined by the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) score. Patients with a poor outcome and nonsurvivors had significantly increased copeptin levels on admission (P\u202f<\u202f.001 both). In the multivariate analysis, for each 1\u202fpmol/l increase of plasma concentration of copeptin, the adjusted risk of poor outcomes and mortality would be increased by and 6% (1.06 [1.02-1.10], P\u202f<\u202f.001) and 9% (1.09 [1.03-1.13], P\u202f<\u202f.001), respectively. Receiver operating characteristics to predict functional outcome and mortality demonstrated areas under the curve of copeptin of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.81) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.87), which was comparable with the WFNS score(P\u202f>\u202f.05) but superior to C-reactive protein and IL-6 (P\u202f<\u202f.01).

Anthropometric measurements and analysis of body composition were done. Serum levels of CRP, albumin, and hemoglobin were determined. Retrospectively, in 2018, diagnosis of malnutrition was verified using ESPEN 2015 and GLIM 2018 criteria. Gastrointestinal complaints were present in 76.8% of respondents.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity has been associated with improved survival, but it is unclear whether this increase in longevity is accompanied by preserved mental and physical functioning, also known as healthy ageing. We designed this study to determine whether physical activity is associated with healthy ageing in later life. METHODS: We recruited a community-representative sample of 12 201 men aged 65-83 years and followed them for 10-13 years. We assessed physical activity at the beginning and the end of the follow-up period. Participants who reported 150 min or more of vigorous physical activity per week were considered physically active. We monitored survival during the follow-up period and, at study exit, assessed the mood, cognition and functional status of survivors. Healthy ageing was defined as being alive at the end of follow-up and having a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score >27, and no major difficulty in any instrumental or basic activity of daily living. Cox regression and general linear models were used to estimate HR of death and risk ratio (RR) of healthy ageing. Analyses were adjusted for age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index and history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. RESULTS: Two thousand and fifty-eight (16.9%) participants were physically active at study entry. Active men had lower HR of death over 10-13 years than physically inactive men (HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.68 to 0.81). Among survivors, completion of the follow-up assessment was higher in the physically active than inactive group (risk ratio, RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.08 to 1.30). Physically active men had greater chance of fulfilling criteria for healthy ageing than inactive men (RR=1.35, 95% CI=1.19 to 1.53). Men who were physically active at the baseline and follow-up assessments had the highest chance of healthy ageing compared with inactive men (RR=1.59, 95% CI=1.36 to 1.86). CONCLUSIONS: Sustained physical activity is associated with improved survival and healthy ageing in older men. Vigorous physical activity seems to promote healthy ageing and should be encouraged when safe and feasible.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: There are higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation among those with chronic diseases, including end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death worldwide and is more prevalent among transplant recipients. Although transplantation has the potential to improve quality of life, many transplant recipients commit suicide each year. The extent to which sex, race, age, type of insurance coverage, time on waitlist, comorbidities, immunosuppressive regimen and graft loss contribute to suicide risk in this population remains understudied. METHODS: We queried UNOS data collected between 1990 and 2019 to determine what risk factors contribute to suicide in the transplant population. Suicide mortality rate was calculated by determining the fraction of organ recipients who died by suicide since 1990 and was expressed as deaths per 100\u00a0000. Two groups (suicide and all other cause mortality) were compared via univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Time to graft loss was estimated using a Kaplan Meier Product Limit method. A propensity score analysis was performed to match patients who committed suicide to those who did not, allowing us to balance the relatively small sample of size of the suicide cohort with the larger all other cause mortality group to minimize the effect of confounding variables. We estimated years of organ life lost using the restricted mean. Statistical significance was defined by p\u00a0<\u00a0.05. RESULTS: The data included 135\u00a0432 transplant deaths in total; the majority were kidney recipients-82\u00a0305 (61%). We determined suicide rates of .28%, .31%, and .44% for kidney, liver and pancreas, respectively, with an overall rate of .3%. Across all three organs the most significant risk factor was male sex. Non-Hispanic whites were also at elevated risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.16, p\u00a0<\u00a0.003). In the liver and kidney transplant groups, the odds of committing suicide were reduced by 4% with advancing age. The odds of taking one's own life was inversely related to BMI in the kidney and pancreas groups. We observed a doubling of suicide rates from .3% in 2014 to .6% in 2018. There were no other statistically significant correlations. CONCLUSION: Suicide is more prevalent among transplant recipients than in the general population. White males in particular are most at risk. The highest rate of suicide was in pancreas recipients. Advancing age and increasing BMI conferred some protective effect. There were no significant associations between suicide incidence and glucocorticoid use, type of insurance coverage, time on waitlist or graft loss. The phenomenon has become more prevalent in recent years.",

CASE DESCRIPTION: This report describes the unfavorable clinical course of a previously healthy 6-months-old female infant who initially presented symptoms of fever and respiratory problems. A chest X-ray revealed an increased cardiac area with no radiographic changes in the lungs. After identifying a pericardial effusion, the patient experienced seizures and went into coma. Pneumonia was excluded as a possibility during the clinical investigation. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures. An initial neurological examination showed that the patient was brain dead, which was then later confirmed according to protocol. COMMENTS: Purulent pericarditis has become a rare complication of invasive pneumococcal disease since the advent of antibiotic therapy. Patients with extensive pneumonia are primarily predisposed and, even with early and adequate treatment, are prone to high mortality rates. The association of pneumococcal meningitis and pericarditis is uncommon, and therefore difficult to diagnose. As such, diagnostic suspicion must be high in order to institute early treatment and increase survival.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis burden among the incarcerated population is generally higher than that of general population. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are key strategies to contain disease transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the time to treatment initiation among inmates with new smear or Xpert MTB/RIF positive pulmonary tuberculosis and explore risk factors associated with delayed treatment initiation in prison settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine health care data from prison settings in Kzrgyz Republic on new pulmonary tuberculosis patients confirmed by smear microscopy or GeneXpert MTB/RIF during 2014-2019. We computed delay in start of treatment-days from specimen collection to treatment initiation-for exposure variables. We dichotomized treatment delay using 10-day cut-off point,and used logistic regression to identify factors associated with treatment delay. RESULTS: Among 406 cases included into analysis, the median delay to treatment initiation was 7 days [IQR: 2-16 days]. Using 10-day cut-off, 189 (46.6%) patients had delayed treatment initiation. Treatment delay was negatively associated with smear positivity [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.68] compared to smear negative patients, while patients with isoniazid resistant (aOR = 2.61, 95%CI 1.49-4.56) and rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (aOR = 4.14, 95%CI 2.56-6.77) had increased delay compared to patients who were sensitive for both rifampicin and isoniazid. CONCLUSION: Timely diagnosis and effective treatment remain the cornerstone of TB control program populations in the general and in prison settings in particular. Prison authorities need to address all potential areas of delay in TB diagnosis and treatment to strengthen their TB control efforts so that prisons remain free of TB for detainees, prison staff and visitors. These include improved supply of TB drugs, early detection of TB cases and improved collaboration with the health authorities outside the prison system.",

With vaccines becoming widely available, dermatologists need to be familiar with the risks and benefits of vaccination in these patients, particularly those taking biologics, in order to have informed discussions with their patients. In this review, we present the current evidence related to COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in patients with IMID and review existing recommendations for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Given the current evidence, there is minimal concern that these patients are at any greater risk of harm from COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls. For most, the benefit of avoiding severe COVID-19 through vaccination will outweigh the theoretical risk of these vaccines. A question that is still outstanding is whether patients on biologics will generate a sufficient immune response to the vaccine, which may be dependent on the specific biologic therapy and indication being treated. This underscores the importance of following patients with IMID after vaccination to determine the safety, efficacy, and duration of the vaccine in this population.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of patients receiving oral anticoagulants are undergoing elective surgery. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is frequently applied as bridging therapy during perioperative interruption of anticoagulation. The aim of this study was to explore the postoperative bleeding risk of patients receiving surgery under bridging anticoagulation. METHODS: We performed a monocentric retrospective two-arm matched cohort study. Patients that received perioperative bridging anticoagulation were compared to a matched control group with identical surgical procedure, age, and sex. Emergency and vascular operations were excluded. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major postoperative bleeding. Secondary endpoints were minor postoperative bleeding, thromboembolic events, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis explored risk factors of major postoperative bleeding. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients in each study arm were analyzed. The patient cohort included the entire field of general and visceral surgery including a large proportion of major oncological resections. Bridging anticoagulation increased the postoperative incidence of major bleeding events (8% vs. 1%; p < 0.001) as well as minor bleeding events (14% vs. 5%; p < 0.001). Thromboembolic events were equally rare in both groups (1% vs. 2%; p = 0.45). No effect on mortality was observed (1.5% vs. 1.9%). Independent risk factors of major postoperative bleeding were full-therapeutic dose of LMWH, renal insufficiency, and the procedure-specific bleeding risk. CONCLUSION: Perioperative bridging anticoagulation, especially full-therapeutic dose LMWH, markedly increases the risk of postoperative bleeding complications in general and visceral surgery. Surgeons should carefully consider the practice of routine bridging.",

At a median follow-up of 71.9 months, the 8-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), relapse, and NRM were 68%, 46%, 41%, and 23%, respectively. In univariate analysis, predictors of OS included first chronic phase (CP1) disease status at HSCT (P = .0005), European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score 1 to 4 (P = .04), and complete molecular response (CMR) to HSCT (P < .0001). Donor (female) to patient (male) gender combination (P = .02) and CMR to HSCT (P < .0001) predicted lower relapse. In multivariate analysis, CMR to HSCT remained an independent predictor of OS (odds ratio [OR], 43), EFS (OR, 56) and relapse (OR, 29). This report indicates that the outlook is excellent for those patients who remain in CP1 at the time of HSCT and achieve a CMR after HSCT. However, only approximately 50% of those in advanced phase at HSCT are long-term survivors. This highlights the ongoing need to try to identify patients earlier, before disease progression, who are destined to fail this treatment to optimize transplantation outcomes.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Family history of psychopathology is a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders in children, but little is known about rates of parental psychopathology among treatment-seeking youth with affective disorders in the Asia Pacific region. This study examined patterns of emotional and behavioural problems in parents of clinically-referred youth in Singapore. We hypothesised that parents would have higher rates of affective disorders compared to the Singapore national prevalence rate of 12%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 47 families were recruited from affective disorders and community-based psychiatry programmes run by a tertiary child psychiatry clinic. All children had a confirmed primary clinical diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder. Parents completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess for lifetime mood and anxiety disorders. They also completed the Adult Self Report (ASR) and Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL) to assess current internalising and externalising symptoms. RESULTS: Consistent with our hypothesis, 38.5% of mothers and 10.5% of fathers reported a lifetime mood and anxiety disorder. Nearly 1/3 of mothers had clinical/subclinical scores on current internalising and externalising problems. A similar pattern was found for internalising problems among fathers, with a slightly lower rate of clinical/subclinical externalising problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with previous overseas studies showing elevated rates of affective disorders among parents - particularly mothers - of children seeking outpatient psychiatric care. Routine screening in this population may help to close the current treatment gap for adults with mood and anxiety disorders.",

        "a": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with worse outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and impact of new-onset AF after primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. HORIZONS-AMI was a large-scale, multicenter, international, randomized trial comparing different antithrombotic regimens and stents during primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions. Three-year ischemic and bleeding end points were compared between patients with and without new-onset AF after PCI. Of the 3,602 patients included in the HORIZONS-AMI study, 3,281 (91.1%) with sinus rhythm at initial presentation had primary PCI as their primary management strategy. Of these, new-onset AF developed in 147 (4.5%). Compared with patients without AF after PCI, patients with new-onset AF had higher 3-year rates of net adverse clinical events (46.5% vs 25.7%, p\u00a0<0.0001), mortality (11.9% vs 6.3%, p\u00a0= 0.01), reinfarction (16.4% vs 7.0%, p <0.0001), stroke (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.0001), and major bleeding (20.9% vs 8.2%, p <0.0001). By multivariate analysis, new-onset AF after PCI was a powerful independent predictor of net\u00a0adverse clinical events (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.36) at 3 years. In conclusion, new-onset AF after PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with markedly higher rates of adverse events and mortality.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) represents a heterogeneous disease, where a non-negligible proportion of patients harbor favorable pathologic characteristics and are potentially eligible for active surveillance (AS). We aimed at developing a model for the identification of pathologically favorable PCa at radical prostatectomy (RP) among intermediate-risk patients. METHODS: Overall, 3,821 intermediate-risk patients treated with RP at two centers between 2005 and 2013 were identified. Pathologically favorable PCa was defined as low-grade organ-confined disease. Age, biopsy Gleason, PSA density (PSAD), and the percentage of positive cores were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting favorable PCa and formed the basis for a logistic regression-based risk calculator. The internally validated discrimination and calibration of the risk calculator were quantified using 200 bootstrap resamples. Decision curve analysis (DCA) provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained using this model versus treating no one and treating everyone. RESULTS: Overall, 10.0% of all intermediate risk patients had favorable disease. In multivariable analyses, patients with biopsy Gleason score \u22646 had higher probability of favorable disease compared to those with higher-grade disease (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, age, PSAD, and percentage of positive cores were associated with the probability of favorable disease (all P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). The risk calculator achieved a validated accuracy of 82.5%. The DCA showed that our prediction model is better than both treating no one and treating everyone. CONCLUSIONS: One out of ten intermediate-risk patients harbors favorable disease at RP. Our novel, pre-operative, validated risk calculator may help clinicians identifying patients who could be considered for conservative therapy approaches such as AS.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the most serious gastrointestinal malignancies with bad prognosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, which may affect the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can affect the prognosis of cancer through regulating the ferroptosis process, which could be potential overall survival (OS) prediction factors for gastric cancer. METHODS: Ferroptosis-related lncRNA expression profiles and the clinicopathological and OS information were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the FerrDb database. The differentially expressed ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were screened with the DESeq2 method. Through co-expression analysis and functional annotation, we then identified the associations between ferroptosis-related lncRNAs and the OS rates for gastric cancer patients. Using Cox regression analysis with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, we constructed a prognostic model based on 17 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs. We also evaluated the prognostic power of this model using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A ferroptosis-related \"lncRNA-mRNA\" co-expression network was constructed. Functional annotation revealed that the FOXO and HIF-1 signaling pathways were dysregulated, which might control the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Then, a ferroptosis-related gastric cancer prognostic signature model including 17 lncRNAs was constructed. Based on the RiskScore calculated using this model, the patients were divided into a High-Risk group and a low-risk group. The K-M survival curve analysis revealed that the higher the RiskScore, the worse is the obtained prognosis. The ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of our model is 0.751, which was better than those of other published models. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed that the lncRNA signature is an independent risk factor for the OS rates. Finally, using nomogram and DCA, we also observed a preferable clinical practicality potential for prognosis prediction of gastric cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Our prognostic signature model based on 17 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs may improve the overall survival prediction in gastric cancer.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness trials have confirmed the superiority of clozapine in schizophrenia treatment, but little is known about whether the drug's superiority holds across racial-ethnic groups. This study examined the effectiveness by race-ethnicity of clozapine relative to other antipsychotics among adult patients in maintenance antipsychotic treatment. METHODS: Black, Latino, and white Florida Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia receiving maintenance treatment with clozapine or other antipsychotics between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2005, were identified. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate associations between clozapine and race-ethnicity and their interaction; time to discontinuation for any cause was the primary measure of effectiveness. RESULTS: The 20,122 members of the study cohort accounted for 20,122 antipsychotic treatment episodes; 3.7% were treated with clozapine and 96.3% with other antipsychotics. Blacks accounted for 23% of episodes and Latinos for 36%. Unadjusted analyses suggested that Latinos continued on clozapine longer than whites and that Latinos and blacks discontinued other antipsychotics sooner than whites. Adjusted analyses of 749 propensity score-matched sets of clozapine users and other antipsychotic users indicated that risk of discontinuation was lower for clozapine users (risk ratio [RR]=.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.39-.52), an effect that was not moderated by race-ethnicity. Times to discontinuation were longer for clozapine users. Overall risk of antipsychotic discontinuation was higher for blacks (RR=1.56, CI=1.27-1.91) and Latinos (RR=1.23, CI=1.02-1.48). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed clozapine's superior effectiveness and did not find evidence that race-ethnicity modified this effect. The findings highlight the need for efforts to increase clozapine use, particularly among minority groups.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic suture rectopexy for FTRP on recurrence rates and functional outcome at a median follow up of 10 years. METHOD: Prospectively collected data for patients who underwent laparoscopic suture rectopexy for FTRP between 1993 and 2006 were analysed. Laparoscopic rectopexy consisted of circumferential mobilization of the rectum down to the levator followed by suture suspension to promontory. Patients with preexisting constipation or who were unfit for general anaesthesia were not included. Incontinence, quality of life and constipation were assessed by validated scores. Recurrence-free curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine patients with a median age of 62 (15-93) years including 174 women and five men underwent laparoscopic suture rectopexy. There was no mortality. The 30-day complication rate was 4% (partial transection of the left ureter, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, superficial surgical site infection). Data on 172 patients (96%) were available at follow up. There were 10 recurrences of FTRP at 5-year follow up giving a crude recurrence rate of 6%. The actuarial 10-year recurrence rate was 20% (95% CI, 10.8-20.1). Follow-up continence (P < 0.0001) and quality of life were better than preoperatively: lifestyle (P < 0.001), coping (P < 0.001), self-perception (P < 0.005), embarrassment (P < 0.06). Constipation was unchanged. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic suture rectopexy led to few complications, a recurrence rate of 20%, improved continence and quality of life with no worsening of constipation at 10 years.",

As the procedure has evolved, it has been questioned whether it is actually needed, but data are lacking on mid-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of balloon predilation before TAVI. A total of 517 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI from November 2007 to October 2015 were analyzed. The devices implanted included the Medtronic CoreValve (n\u00a0= 216), Medtronic Evolut R (n\u00a0= 30), Edwards SAPIEN XT (n\u00a0= 210), and Edwards SAPIEN 3 (n\u00a0= 61). Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether pre-implantation balloon aortic valvuloplasty (pre-BAV) was performed (n\u00a0= 326) or not (n\u00a0= 191). Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were primarily evaluated. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and potential confounders (n\u00a0= 113 pairs). In the overall cohort, patients without pre-BAV had a significantly higher MACCE rate at 30\u00a0days, driven by a higher incidence of stroke (0.3% pre-BAV vs 3.7% no-pre-BAV, p <0.01). MACCE and mortality at 1\u00a0year were, however, similar in both groups. Independent predictors of MACCE at 1\u00a0year included serum creatinine, NYHA class 3 to 4, logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, and postdilation. Of note, the postdilation rate was higher in the no-pre-BAV group (21.5% pre-BAV vs 35.6% no-pre-BAV, p <0.001). After propensity score matching, there were no differences in MACCE between the 2 groups. In conclusion, this study showed that, in selected patients and with specific transcatheter valves, TAVI without pre-BAV appears to be associated with similar mid-term outcomes compared with TAVI with pre-BAV, but it may increase the need for postdilation.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Studies in chronic noncancer pain settings have found that opioid use increases health care utilization. Despite the key role of analgesics, specifically opioids, in the setting of cancer pain, there is no literature to our knowledge about the relationship between adherence to prescribed around-the-clock (ATC) analgesics and acute health care utilization (hospitalization) among patients with cancer pain. PURPOSE: To identify adherence patterns over time for cancer patients taking ATC analgesics for pain, cluster these patterns into adherence types, combine the types into an adherence risk factor for hospitalization, identify other risk factors for hospitalization, and identify risk factors for inconsistent analgesic adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a 3-month prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with solid tumors or multiple myeloma, having cancer-related pain, and having at least one prescription of oral ATC analgesics were collected. Adherence data were collected electronically using the medication event-monitoring system. Analyses were conducted using adaptive modeling methods based on heuristic search through alternative models controlled by likelihood cross-validation scores. RESULTS: Six adherence types were identified and combined into the risk factor for hospitalization of inconsistent versus consistent adherence over time. Twenty other individually significant risk factors for hospitalization were identified, but inconsistent analgesic adherence was the strongest of these predictors (ie, generating the largest likelihood cross-validation score). These risk factors were adaptively combined into a model for hospitalization based on six pairwise interaction risk factors with exceptional discrimination (ie, area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.91). Patients had from zero to five of these risk factors, with an odds ratio of 5.44 (95% confidence interval 3.09-9.58) for hospitalization, with a unit increase in the number of such risk factors. CONCLUSION: Inconsistent adherence to prescribed ATC analgesics, specifically the interaction of strong opioids and inconsistent adherence, is a strong risk factor for hospitalization among cancer outpatients with pain.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Prospective memory (PM), the ability to remember to carry out an intended action in the future, is thought to relate closely to everyday functioning, such as medication adherence. PM impairment in schizophrenia may contribute to unintentional medication non-adherence. This study aimed to examine the relationship between PM, medication management and medication adherence. METHODS: Eighty-two stable patients with schizophrenia underwent assessment for PM and medication management ability by laboratory measures at baseline. Clinical symptoms, other neuropsychological functions and risk factors known to associate with non-adherence were also measured. Linear regression was used to identify predictors of medication management ability at baseline. Actual medication adherence was assessed three months later and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of non-adherence. RESULTS: In the linear regression model, time- and event-based PM together accounted for 72.3% of the variance in the performance of medication management at baseline. At three-month follow-up, the non-adherent group performed significantly more poorly in time- and event-based PM, and had poorer insight, more severe symptoms and poorer ability to manage medications, as compared to the adherent group. In the logistic regression model, insight and PANSS general score significantly predicted non-adherence in the community. Time- and event-based PM moderated the predictive power of insight and PANSS general score. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that PM performance robustly predicts medication management ability and may influence medication adherence in the community by moderating the effect of insight and symptom severity. Optimizing PM performance may improve medication adherence in the community, particularly for unintentional non-adherence.",

        "a": "Cardiovascular events remain one of the most frequent causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The majority of cardiac events occur in individuals without known coronary artery disease (CAD) and in low- to intermediate-risk subjects. Thus, the development of improved preventive strategies may substantially benefit from the identification, among apparently intermediate-risk subjects, of those who have a high probability for developing future cardiac events. Cardiac computed tomography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) by single photon emission computed tomography may play a role in this setting. In fact, absence of coronary calcium in cardiac computed tomography and inducible ischaemia in MPS are associated with a very low rate of major cardiac events in the next 3-5 years. Based on current evidence, the evaluation of coronary calcium in primary prevention subjects should be considered in patients classified as intermediate-risk based on traditional risk factors, since high calcium scores identify subjects at high-risk who may benefit from aggressive secondary prevention strategies. In addition, calcium scoring should be considered for asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without known CAD to select those in whom further functional testing by MPS or other stress imaging techniques may be considered to identify patients with significant inducible ischaemia. From available data, the use of MPS as first line testing modality for risk stratification is not recommended in any category of primary prevention subjects with the possible exception of first-degree relatives of patients with premature CAD in whom MPS may be considered. However, the Working Group recognizes that neither the use of computed tomography for calcium imaging nor of MPS have been proven to significantly improve clinical outcomes of primary prevention subjects in prospective controlled studies. This information would be crucial to adequately define the role of imaging approaches in cardiovascular preventive strategies.",

In multivariable analysis, only Framingham risk score (p\u202f=\u202f0.009) was independently associated with increased CIMT. The median common carotid artery-CIMT value was significantly greater in patients with intermediate/high compared with those with low Framingham risk score (0.60 vs 0.49 mm; p <0.001).

We sought to contrast individual gait measures as predictors of fall frequency and the EGVI as a single predictor of fall frequency in individuals with PD. 273 patients (189M, 84F; 68\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009yrs) with idiopathic PD walked over an instrumented walkway and reported fall frequency over three months (never, rarely, monthly, weekly, or daily). The predictive ability of gait velocity, step length, step time, stance time, and single support time and the EGVI was assessed using regression techniques to predict fall frequency. The EGVI explained 15.1% of the variance in fall frequency (p < 0.001, r\u2009=\u20090.389). Although the regression using the combined spatiotemporal measures to predict fall frequency was significant (p=0.002, r\u2009=\u20090.264), none of the components reached significance (gait velocity: p=0.640, step length: p=0.900, step time: p=0.525, stance time: p=0.532, single support time: p=0.480). The EGVI is a better predictor of fall frequency in persons with PD than its individual spatiotemporal components. Patients who fall more frequently have more variable gait, based on the interpretation of the EGVI. While the EGVI provides an objective measure of gait variability with some ability to predict fall frequency, full clinical interpretations and applications are currently unknown.",

        "a": "Purpose: To analyze data from an observational, prospective, cumulative registry study in 805 hypogonadal men stratified by mild or moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) according to International Prostate Symptom Score. Materials and Methods: A total of 412 men underwent testosterone therapy (TTh) with injectable testosterone undecanoate, 393 men served as untreated controls. Measures of urinary function, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were performed at least twice per year. Results: Data from 615 men with mild LUTS (253 treated, 362 untreated) and 190 with moderate-to-severe LUTS (159 treated, 31 untreated) were available. During a follow-up period of 8 years a significant improvement of LUTS was noted for all TTh-patients whereas the control-groups showed deterioration or fluctuation around initial values. Despite advancing age, TTh fully prevented worsening of symptoms. In parallel, a considerable improvement of anthropometric parameters, lipids and glycemic control, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and quality of life was found. Moderate-to-severe LUTS was associated with worse cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline as well as worse cardiovascular outcomes during follow-up in comparison to mild LUTS. Effect size of TTh was more pronounced in men with moderate-to-severe than with mild LUTS. Conclusions: Correcting hypogonadism by TTh is highly effective and safe for improving LUTS in hypogonadal men. TTh may also improve cardiometabolic risk and major adverse cardiovascular events.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing gastroenteroscopy during sedation are prone to aspiration, and most patients with dyspepsia have delayed gastric emptying. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of measuring the gastric antrum cross-sectional area (CSA) to supply a novel clinical diagnostic reference value in patients with dyspepsia. METHODS: Patients with dyspepsia undergoing elective gastroscopy were included. The Perlas qualitative 0-2 grading scale score was determined before the operation. The anteroposterior diameter (D1) and craniocaudal diameter (D2) between gastric antrum serosal surfaces were measured perpendicular to each other in the supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions. CSA values in the supine position and RLD position were determined. Gastric contents were endoscopically suctioned with the volumes measured and noted as actual gastric volume. Multiple regression analysis was used to fit a mathematical model for estimating the gastric volume. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the accuracy of RLD CSA to detect gastric volumes of >\u20090.8\u2009ml/kg. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were enrolled and divided into a functional dyspepsia (FD) group and an organic dyspepsia group according to gastroscopy findings. For a gastric volume of >\u20090.8\u2009ml/kg, cut-off values for FD and organic dyspepsia were 6.7\u2009cm2 and 10.0\u2009cm2, respectively. Two new modified mathematical models were derived to predict an estimated gastric volume for FD and organic dyspepsia: volume\u2009=\u20093.93\u2009\u00d7\u2009RLD CSA - 0.47\u2009\u00d7\u2009age; and volume\u2009=\u20096.15\u2009\u00d7\u2009RLD CSA - 0.61\u2009\u00d7\u2009age. CONCLUSION: We used the cut-off value of the antral area for the fast diagnosis of gastric volumes in patients with dyspepsia, which may assist clinicians in identifying patients at risk of aspiration.

Although classical autoimmune diseases have well-known risk factors, including age, gender, and seasonality, the clinical factors that lead to irAEs are not well-defined. To explore these questions, we assessed 455 patients with advanced melanoma treated with ICI at our center and a large pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase). We found that younger age was associated with a similar rate of any irAEs but more frequent severe irAEs and more hospitalizations (OR, 0.97 per year). Paradoxically, however, older patients had more deaths and increased length of stay (LOS) when hospitalized. This was partially due to a distinct toxicity profile: Colitis and hepatitis were more common in younger patients, whereas myocarditis and pneumonitis had an older age distribution both in our center and in VigiBase. This pattern was particularly apparent with combination checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab. We did not find a link between gender or seasonality on development of irAEs in univariate or multivariate analyses, although winter hospitalizations were associated with marginally increased LOS. This study identifies age-specific associations of irAEs.",

        "a": "Summary: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) is the most common aetiology for hypercalcaemia. The incidence of PHP in pregnant women is reported to be 8/100 000 population/year. It presents a threat to the health of both mother (hyperemesis, nephrolithiasis) and fetus (fetal death, congenital malformations, and neonatal severe hypocalcaemia-induced tetany). However, there is a lack of clear guidance on the management of primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy. In this study, we describe the case of a 26-year-old female patient who presented with severe hypercalcaemia secondary to PHP and underwent successful parathyroid adenectomy under local anaesthesia. Learning points: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare complication in pregnancy, but the consequences for mother and fetus can be severe. A perceived risk of general anaesthesia to the fetus in the first trimester has resulted in a general consensus to delay parathyroid surgery to the second trimester when possible - although the increased risk of fetal loss may occur before planned surgery. If the patient presents with severe or symptomatic hypercalcaemia, minimally invasive surgery under local anaesthetic should be considered regardless of the gestational age of the pregnancy.",

        "a": "Prognostic parameters and models were believed to be helpful in improving the treatment outcome for patients with brain metastasis (BM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of computer tomography (CT) radiomics based nomogram to predict the survival of patients with BM from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). A total of 195 patients with BM from NSCLC who underwent WBRT from January 2012 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiomics features were extracted and selected from pretherapeutic CT images with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A nomogram was developed and evaluated by integrating radiomics features and clinical factors to predict the survival of individual patient. Five radiomics features were screened out from 105 radiomics features according to the LASSO Cox regression. According to the optimal cutoff value of radiomics score (Rad-score), patients were stratified into low-risk (Rad-score <= -0.14) and high-risk (Rad-score > -0.14) groups. Multivariable analysis indicated that sex, karnofsky performance score (KPS) and Rad-score were independent predictors for overall survival (OS). The concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram in the training cohort and validation cohort was 0.726 and 0.660, respectively. An area under curve (AUC) of 0.786 and 0.788 was achieved for the short-term and long-term survival prediction, respectively. In conclusion, the nomogram based on radiomics features from CT images and clinical factors was feasible to predict the OS of BM patients from NSCLC who underwent WBRT.",

        "a": "AIMS: To assess gender differences in outcome with an early invasive or non-invasive strategy in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS). METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 46,455 patients [14 819 women (32%) and 31,636 men (68%)] from the SWEDEHEART register, with NSTE ACS, between 2000 and 2006, and followed them for 1 year. In the non-invasive strategy arm, the relative risk (RR) of death was (women vs. men) 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.94-1.11] and in the invasive strategy arm 1.12 (95% CI, 0.96-1.29). After adjustment for baseline differences between the genders, with propensity score and discharge medication, there was a similar trend towards better outcome among women in both the early non-invasive cohort [RR 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.99)] and the early invasive cohort [RR 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76-1.06)], although it did not reach statistical significance in the early invasive cohort. Results were similar with the combined endpoint death/myocardial infarction. An early invasive treatment was associated with a marked, and similar, mortality reduction in women [RR 0.46 (95% CI, 0.38-0.55)] and men [RR 0.45 (95% CI, 0.40-0.52)], without interaction with gender.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs) and disorder (OCD) are often underdiagnosed in the out-patient epilepsy clinic. This work aimed at determining the risks and comorbidities (psychopathological and neurobiological correlates) of OCSs in treated adults with idiopathic epilepsy recruited from a university hospital. METHODS: Psychiatric evaluation was done using DSM-IV (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders). Obsessive-compulsive disorder was identified using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) were used to determine the severity of the related psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 474 patients screened, included in this study were 107 with no psychiatric symptoms and 188 with OCSs [classified as those with at least OCSs=93; mild OCSs=36; moderate, severe, and extreme OCSs=59]. A hundred healthy subjects were included as controls. Blood concentrations of serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine were measured. Compared with controls, patients with OCSs had higher frequencies of depression and anxiety. Low concentrations of serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine were reported regardless of the presence or the absence of psychiatric symptoms, OCS severities, and antiepileptic drug (AED)-related variables (dose and serum drug level). Significant correlations were identified between Y-BOCS, BDI-II, and HAM-A scores, age, age at onset, and concentrations of noradrenaline. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that a) OCSs are common in patients with epilepsy. Male sex, age, duration of illness, seizure focus, lateralization, and intractability to AEDs are its main risks; b) depression and anxiety are comorbid psychopathologies; and c) serotonin, catecholamines, and dopamine are linked to epilepsy-related variables and its comorbid psychopathies but not to its medications.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: The treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) involves different care providers across care sites. This fragmentation of care increases the morbidity and mortality burden, as well as acute health services use. The COPD-Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) was designed and implemented to integrate the care across different sites from primary care to acute hospital and home. It aims to reduce the prevalence of COPD among the population in the catchment, reduce risk of hospital admissions, delay or prevent the progression of the disease and reduce mortality rate by adopting a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach to the management of the patients' medical conditions. This study on the COPD-ICP programme is undertaken to determine the impact on processes of care, clinical outcomes and acute care utilisation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a retrospective, pre-post, matched-groups study to evaluate the effectiveness of the COPD-ICP programme in improving clinical outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Programme enrolees (intervention group) and non-enrolees (comparator group) will be matched using propensity scores. Administratively, we set 30% as our target for proportion admission difference between programme and non-programme patients. A sample size of 62 patients in each group will be needed for statistical comparisons to be made at 90% power. Adherence with recommended care elements will be measured at baseline and quarterly during 1-year follow-up. Risk of COPD-related hospitalisations as primary outcome, healthcare costs, disease progression and 1-year mortality during 1-year follow-up will be compared between the groups using generalised linear regression models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol describes the implementation and proposed evaluation of the COPD-ICP programme. The described study has received ethical approval from the NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB Ref: 2013/01200). Results of the study will be reported through peer-review publications and presentations at healthcare conferences.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as bacteriuria without signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI), occurs in 17% to 51% of kidney transplant recipients and is thought to increase the risk for a subsequent UTI. No consensus exists on the role of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplantation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients with antimicrobial agents to prevent symptomatic UTI, all-cause mortality and the indirect effects of UTI (acute rejection, graft loss, worsening of graft function). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 September 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in any language assessing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients at any time-point after transplantation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were incidence of symptomatic UTI and incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Other outcomes included incidences of all-cause mortality, graft loss, graft rejection, graft function, hospitalisation for UTI, adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents and relapse or persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as absolute risk difference (RD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies (212 participants) comparing antibiotics versus no treatment, and identified three on-going studies. Overall, incidence of symptomatic UTI varied between 19% and 31% in the groups not treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotic treatment had uncertain effects on preventing symptomatic UTI (2 studies, 200 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.45). Risk for selecting multidrug-resistant organisms was uncertain with antibiotic treatment (1 study, 112 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.41). Persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was high regardless of treatment. Antibiotics also have uncertain effects on other important patient and graft outcomes, for instance on all-cause mortality (1 study, 112 participants: RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.21 to 23.86), graft loss (1 study, 112 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.36), acute rejection (1 study, 112 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.97), hospitalisation for UTI (1 study, 112 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.27), graft function (2 studies, 200 participants, MD in serum creatinine concentration -0.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.08) and adverse reactions (1 study, 112 participants: no severe adverse event attributable to the antibiotic treatment). Evidence quality was low for all outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support routinely treating kidney transplant recipients with antibiotics in case of asymptomatic bacteriuria after transplantation, but data are scarce. Further studies assessing routine antibiotic treatment would inform practice and we await the results of three ongoing randomised studies, which may help resolve existing uncertainties.",

METHODS: Virologically suppressed patients with HIV-1 switching to dolutegravir\u00a0+\u00a0lamivudine or rilpivirine or to a dolutegravir-based three-drug regimen (3DR) with pre-baseline genotype were selected. Virological failure (VF) was defined as one HIV-RNA viral load (VL) >200 cps/mL or two consecutive VL >50 cps/mL; treatment failure (TF) was defined as VF or treatment discontinuation (TD). Resistance was defined as at least low-level resistance to at least one drug of the current regimen. Propensity score matching was used to conduct adjusted analyses within a competing risks framework. RESULTS: A total of 971 dolutegravir-based regimens were selected: 339 (34.9%) 2DR and 632 (65.1%) 3DR. The adjusted cumulative 48-week incidence of VF was 4.2% (90% CI 3.1%-5.3%) with 2DR and 4.7% (90% CI 3.5%-5.8%) with 3DR. The cumulative 48-week incidence of TF was 15.8% (90% CI 13.9%-17.9%) with 2DR and 24.5% (90% CI 22.2%-27.0%) with 3DR. For VF, the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for 2DR vs. 3DR was 1.02 (90% CI: 0.78-1.34), with evidence of effect modification by low-level resistance (HR 3.96, 90% CI: 2.10-7.46). The estimated HR of TF for 2DR vs. 3DR was 0.54 (90% CI: 0.48-0.60). The 48-week cumulative incidence of TD was 11.7% (8.7%, 14.6%) in 2DR and 19.6% (16.9%, 22.4%) in 3DR. CONCLUSIONS: Dolutegravir-based 2DR showed high virological efficacy and durability; however, past resistance increased the risk of VF, but not of TD or TF.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of LV diastolic dysfunction on the long-term outcome in patients with LEAD. METHODS: Two hundred LEAD patients (male 66 %, mean age 76\u00b19 years) with preserved LV systolic function assessed by echocardiography (ejection fraction \u226550 %) were enrolled from a single center database between January 2013 and May 2015. We divided the patients into two groups on the basis of LV diastolic dysfunction, which was diagnosed based on the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines. The 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint was compared between LEAD patients with LV diastolic dysfunction and those without. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE: death, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether LV diastolic dysfunction was independently associated with the MACCE. RESULTS: LV diastolic dysfunction was identified in 31 % of LEAD patients. The mean observation period was 32\u00b121 months. The 3-year cumulative incidence of MACCE occurred more frequently in patients with LV diastolic dysfunction than those without (35 % vs 23 %, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, LV diastolic dysfunction (HR=1.96, 95 % CI 1.09-3.55, p=0.03) and critical limb ischemia (HR=2.52, 95 % CI 1.24-5.10, p=0.01) were an independent predictor for MACCE.

        "a": "CONTEXT: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is acknowledged as an effective antidote for paracetamol overdose. However, adverse effects to NAC are common and may be a point of concern for the patient and the treating physician. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to further analyse possible risk factors of anaphylactoid adverse effects to intravenous NAC in order to identify individual patients or groups of patients at particular risk. METHODS: This study is an observational case series of adverse effects to NAC administered according to the standard guidelines in patients who presented with paracetamol overdose between March 1999 and September 2011. RESULTS: A total of 1218 admissions for paracetamol overdose receiving intravenous NAC were recorded in 950 patients. Anaphylactoid adverse effects occurred in 18.6%. The proportion of cases with adverse effects gradually declined from 25.9% in cases with undetectable p-paracetamol to 6.3% in cases with p-paracetamol above 1.5 mmol/L (226 \u03bcg/mL) (Spearman Rank R-test: p < 0.00001). The proportion of cases with adverse effects was significantly higher in cases of non-Danish origin than that of Danish origin (28.5% vs. 15.1%; Chi-square: p < 0.00001). In patients with repeated exposure to NAC, the rate of adverse effects on re-exposure was significantly higher in patients with a previous reaction to NAC compared to those without a previous reaction (Rate Ratio 6.2; 95% CI 2.9-17.1). CONCLUSION: The development of anaphylactoid adverse effects to intravenous NAC was strongly associated with a low p-paracetamol, non-Danish origin and a history of previous reaction to NAC. These adverse effects are common, but usually mild and easily manageable. The incidence of adverse effects may be reduced by pre-treating selected patients with antihistamines, in particular those with a previous reaction to NAC.",

        "a": "Modified NUTRIC (mNUTRIC) score is a useful assessment tool to determine the risk of malnutrition in patients on mechanical ventilation (MV). We identified associations between postoperative calorie adequacy, 30-day mortality, and surgical outcomes in patients with high mNUTRIC scores. Medical records of 272 patients in the intensive care unit who required MV support for >24 h after emergency gastro-intestinal (GI) surgery between January 2007 and December 2017 were reviewed. Calorie adequacy in percentage (Calorie intake in 5 days \u00f7 Calorie requirement for 5 days \u00d7 100) was assessed in patients with high (5\u207b9) and low (0\u207b4) mNUTRIC scores. In the high mNUTRIC score group, patients with inadequate calorie supplementation (calorie adequacy <70%) had higher 30-day mortality than those with adequate supplementation (31.5% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.010); this was not observed in patients with low mNUTRIC scores. This result was also confirmed through Kaplan\u207bMeier survival curve (p = 0.022). Inadequate calorie supplementation in the high mNUTRIC score group was not associated with Intra-abdominal infection (p = 1.000), pulmonary complication (p = 0.695), wound complication (p = 0.407), postoperative leakage (p = 1.000), or infections (p = 0.847). Inadequate calorie supplementation after GI surgery was associated with higher 30-day mortality in patients with high mNUTRIC scores. Therefore, adequate calorie supplementation could contribute to improved survival of critically ill postoperative patients with high risk of malnutrition.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: No study has examined the association of the calcification of abdominal artery orifices with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) in dialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether calcification of abdominal blood vessel orifices in hemodialysis patients may be a risk factor for NOMI and examine the long-term survival of dialysis patients after undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: From April 2014 to September 2020, 100 dialysis patients underwent cardiac surgery at our hospital. The calcification of the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was evaluated by computed tomography, and the degree of orifice stenosis was graded as follows: patent, 0; partial occlusion, 1; and complete occlusion, 2. RESULTS: Eight patients experienced NOMI, and all of them died. SMA calcification scores were not significantly different between the NOMI and non-NOMI groups (1.38\u00b10.52 vs. 1.13\u00b10.69; P = 0.247). However, the average CA orifice calcification score was significantly greater in the NOMI group than in the non-NOMI group (1.63\u00b10.52 vs. 1.15\u00b10.65; P = 0.039), and the SMA+CA orifice calcification scores were significantly different between the groups (3.00\u00b10.76 vs. [non-NOMI] 2.25\u00b11.18; P = 0.028). In all patients, the 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 13% and 18%, respectively. All patients were completely followed up with a mean follow-up period of 604\u00b1585 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with SMA and CA calcification tended to have a shorter overall survival than patients without calcification; however, no significant difference was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The calcification of CA and/or SMA orifices was associated with postoperative NOMI and poor long-term survival among dialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

        "a": "In this review we report on the state of cell therapy of critical limb ischemia (CLI) with respect to differences between diabetic and non-diabetic patients mainly from the clinical point of view. CLI is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease and its diagnosis and treatment in diabetic patients is very difficult. The therapeutic effect of standard methods of CLI treatment is only partial - more than one third of diabetic patients are not eligible for standard revascularization; therefore, new therapeutic techniques such as cell therapy have been studied in clinical trials. Presence of CLI in patients with diabetic foot disease is associated with worse clinical outcomes such as lack of healing of foot ulcers, major amputations and premature mortality. A revascularization procedure cannot be successful as the only method in contrast to patients without diabetes, but it must always be part of a complex therapy focused not only on ischemia, but also on treatment of infection, off-loading, metabolic control of diabetes and nutrition, local therapy, etc. Therefore, the main criteria for cell therapy may vary in diabetic patients and non-diabetic persons and results of this treatment method should always be assessed in the context of ensuring comprehensive therapy. This review carries out an analysis of the source of precursor cells, route of administration and brings a brief report of published data with respect to diabetic and non-diabetic patients and our experience with autologous cell therapy of diabetic patients with CLI. Analysis of the studies in terms of diabetes is difficult, because in most of them sub-analysis for diabetic patients is not performed separately. The other problem is that it is not clear if diabetic patients received adequate complex treatment for their foot ulcers which can strongly affect the rate of major amputation as an outcome of CLI treatment.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a multicomponent intervention improves care in hospitalized older adults with cognitive impairment. DESIGN: One-year retrospective chart review with propensity score matching on critical demographic and clinical variables was used to compare individauls with cognitive impairmenet on intervention and nonintervention units. SETTING: Large tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: All hospitalized individuals age 65 and older with cognitive impairment admitted to medicine who required constant or enhanced observation for behavioral and psychological symptoms. INTERVENTION: Multicomponent intervention (geographic unit cohorting, multidisciplinary approach, patient engagement specialists (PES), staff education) or usual care. MEASUREMENTS: In-hospital mortality, length of stay, readmission, management of behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 476 of the 712 intervention visits were pair-matched with 476 of the 558 usual care visits. Matching was successful in balancing baseline covariates between intervention and usual care units. Individuals admitted to the intervention unit had lower in-hospital mortality (1.1% vs 2.9%, p=0.05) and shorter stays (5.0 vs 5.8 days, p=0.04). There was no difference in discharge home (p=0.90) or 30-day readmission rates (p=0.44). Individuals on the intervention unit were less likely than those receivng usual care to have an order for constant (12.0% vs 45.8%, p<0.01) or enhanced (22.1% vs 79.6%, p<0.01) observation, to be taking benzodiazepines (26.3% vs 38.0%, p<0.01), to be taking nothing by mouth (29.6% vs 40.8%, p=0.01), to be on bedrest (17.0% vs 25.8%, p=0.01), to be taking antipsychotics (41.2% vs 54.0%, p<0.01), or to have restraints (3.2% vs 6.9%, p=.01). CONCLUSION: A multicomponent intervention of geographic cohorting, multidisciplinary approach, PES, and staff education may offer a new paradigm in the management of hospitalized older adults with cognitive impairment.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) are branches of the vagus nerve that go on to innervate most of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. Historically, the RLN has been considered to branch after it enters the larynx, but numerous studies have demonstrated that it often branches before. The wide variability of this extralaryngeal branching (ELB) has significant implications for the risk of iatrogenic injury. We aimed to assess the anatomical characteristics of ELB comprehensively. METHODS: Articles on the ELB of the RLN were identified by a comprehensive database search. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into a meta-analysis of the prevalence of branching, branching pattern, distance of ELB point from the larynx, and presence of positive motor signals in anterior and posterior ELB branches. RESULTS: A total of 69 articles (n\u2009=\u200928,387 nerves) from both intraoperative and cadaveric modalities were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of ELB was 60.0\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 52.0-67.7). Cadaveric and intraoperative subgroups differed with prevalence rates of 73.3\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 61.0-84.0) and 39.2\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 29.0-49.9), respectively. Cadavers most often presented with a ELB pattern of bifurcation, with a prevalence of 61.1\u00a0%, followed by no branching at 23.4\u00a0%. Branching of the RLN occurred most often at a distance of 1-2\u00a0cm (74.8\u00a0% of cases) prior to entering the larynx. A positive motor signal was most often noted in anterior RLN branches (99.9\u00a0%) but only in 1.5\u00a0% of posterior branches. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of the RLN is highly variable, and ELB is likely to have been underreported in intraoperative studies. Because of its high likelihood, the possibility of ELB needs to be assessed in patients to prevent iatrogenic injury and long-term postoperative complications.",

        "a": "Carriers of the fragile X premutation (PM) can develop a variety of early neurological symptoms, including depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment as well as being at risk for developing the late-onset fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The absence of effective treatments for FXTAS underscores the importance of developing efficacious therapies to reduce the neurological symptoms in elderly PM carriers and FXTAS patients. A recent preliminary study reported that weekly infusions of Allopregnanolone (Allop) may improve deficits in executive function, learning and memory in FXTAS patients. Based on this study we examined whether Allop would improve neurological function in the aged CGG knock-in (CGG KI) dutch mouse, B6.129P2(Cg)-Fmr1tm2Cgr/Cgr, that models much of the symptomatology in PM carriers and FXTAS patients. Wild type and CGG KI mice received 10 weekly injections of Allop (10 mg/kg, s.c.), followed by a battery of behavioral tests of motor function, anxiety, and repetitive behavior, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to examine adult neurogenesis. The results provided evidence that Allop in CGG KI mice normalized motor performance and reduced thigmotaxis in the open field, normalized repetitive digging behavior in the marble burying test, but did not appear to increase adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Considered together, these results support further examination of Allop as a therapeutic strategy in patients with FXTAS.",

The number of patients with CRS has been constantly growing. The coexistence of CRS, bronchial asthma and aspirin intolerance (aspirin triad) is an adverse prognostic factor with higher risk of recurrences. The aim of study was to compare the severity of CRSwNP depending of coexistence of bronchial asthma and/or aspirin intolerance. The research was performed in the group of 204 patients operated 2009-2013 with 5 years follow-up. Higher nasal polyps growth in groups of patients with aspirin triad and CRSwNP and bronchial asthma in endoscopic examination (p=0,0005 and p=0,0030 respectively) and CT-scan according to Lund-Mackay point scale (p&lt;0,0001 and p=0,0009) was showed. Also, these patients presented increased severity of nasal symptoms before surgical treatment according to VAS scale (p=0,0126 for CRSwNP with bronchial asthma; p=0,0390 for aspirin triad). Similarly, 6 months after surgery the same groups of patients presented higher severity of the disease symptoms (p&lt;0,0001 for aspirin triad' patients; p=0,0174 for CRSwNP and bronchial asthma' patients) . Patients with aspirin triad had also statistically more surgeries in past (p=0,001), what proves that recurrences in this group are very likely to be observed in spite of the use of proper conservative treatment. No such differences have been shown in the group of patients with CRSwNP and isolated aspirin intolerance (without bronchial asthma). Allergy to inhaled allergens, hypersensitivity to aspirin are factors significantly worsening the course of CRSwNP. It would be advisable to consider, despite a lack of history of aspirin intolerance, a hypersensititvity to aspirin test in patients with particularly severe CRSwNP, especially those associated with bronchial asthma. It also seems reasonable to carry out such a test on every patient with newly diagnosed CRSwNP and bronchial asthma in order to be able to plan further treatment in this group of patients accordingly including biological treatment with antimonoclonal therapy against interleukin 4, 5 or13.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Since there are difficulties in establishing effective treatments for COVID-19, a vital way to reduce mortality is an early intervention to prevent disease progression. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of patients with COVID-19 with acute hypoxic respiratory failure according to pulmonary impairment in the awake-prone position, outside of the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on COVID-19 patients under noninvasive respiratory support. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained for each patient before the treatment and after they were placed in the awake-prone position. To identify responders and non-responders after the first prone maneuver, receiver operating characteristic curves with sensitivity and specificity of the PaO2/FiO2 and SpO2/FiO2 indices were analyzed. The maneuver was considered positive if the patient did not require endotracheal intubation for ventilatory assistance. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included, and 64.6% were categorized as responders. The SpO2/FiO2 index was effective for predicting endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients regardless of lung parenchymal damage (area under the curve 0.84, cutoff point 165, sensitivity 85%, specificity 75%). Responders had better outcomes with lower hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.107, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.012-0.93) and a shorter length of stay (median difference 6 days, HR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.66) after adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The awake-prone position for COVID-19 patients outside the ICU can improve oxygenation and clinical outcomes regardless of the extent of pulmonary impairment. Furthermore, the SpO2/FiO2 index discriminates responders from non-responders to the prone maneuver predicting endotracheal intubation with a cutoff under or below 165.",

This study aimed to estimate the effects of ondansetron use on AKI patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the MIMIC-IV database to compare AKI patient mortality in the ICU with and without ondansetron and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were applied to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS: In total, 26,004 AKI patients were included. Ondansetron use reduced in-hospital mortality risk by 16% among AKI patients (HR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.77-0.90, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly reduced among patients administered ondansetron at AKI stage 1 (11.4% vs. 16.5%. p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and stage 2 (16.1% vs. 19.6%. p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not stage 3 (24.0% vs. 23.9%. p\u00a0=\u00a00.890). Patients younger than 60\u00a0years or receiving surgery received greater benefits from ondansetron use. (HR: 0.62, 95%CI:0.53-0.72 and HR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.50-0.69, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study showed that ondansetron use is significantly associated with reduced risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality in stages 1 and 2 AKI patients in the ICU.

Over the past decade, substantial advances in the treatment of VTE have been achieved. Most notably, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were introduced, which offer simple treatment regimens across a broad spectrum of patients with VTE and have become the first\u2011choice anticoagulants in many individuals in this population. Even though elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, the extrapolation of overall study results to the elderly subpopulation can be considered justified regarding acute VTE treatment and the choice of anticoagulant agent. In the elderly, DOACs are not only associated with a lower bleeding risk but they also appear to be even more efficacious than vitamin K antagonists in preventing recurrent VTE during the acute treatment period. Determining the optimal treatment duration is the most challenging aspect of VTE management in elderly patients. The risk of bleeding increases with advancing age, and several risk factors for recurrent VTE after stopping anticoagulation are also more frequent in the elderly. Clinical decision rules estimating the risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding have limited utility in elderly patients. Shared decision making considering patients' preferences and values is therefore crucial to help determine individual treatment duration in these patients.",

We employed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the genetic background of bacterial isolates. Sequence types (STs) of isolates were ST-335 (one allele variant of ST-19) and ST-23. ST-335 is an epidemic invasive GBS disease strain in Japan and is dominantly correlated with serotype III. ST-23 is highly associated with serotype Ia and is also a common invasive type in Europe, the United States and Japan. Our findings suggest that ULOD likely develops combined with underlying host disease, immunological factors and highly virulent strains. Continuous investigation of large numbers of cases is needed to better understand ULOD etiology.",

        "a": "Electronic medical records (EMRs) for diabetic patients contain information about heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. Discovering the described risk factors and tracking their progression over time may support medical personnel in making clinical decisions, as well as facilitate data modeling and biomedical research. Such highly patient-specific knowledge is essential to driving the advancement of evidence-based practice, and can also help improve personalized medicine and care. One general approach for tracking the progression of diseases and their risk factors described in EMRs is to first recognize all temporal expressions, and then assign each of them to the nearest target medical concept. However, this method may not always provide the correct associations. In light of this, this work introduces a context-aware approach to assign the time attributes of the recognized risk factors by reconstructing contexts that contain more reliable temporal expressions. The evaluation results on the i2b2 test set demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, which achieved an F-score of 0.897. To boost the approach's ability to process unstructured clinical text and to allow for the reproduction of the demonstrated results, a set of developed .NET libraries used to develop the system is available at https://sites.google.com/site/hongjiedai/projects/nttmuclinicalnet.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) since birth are linked to the early onset of atherosclerotic disease. A genetic mutation determining FH is present in about one subject out of 250; FH should be more represented among subjects with a documented diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The POSTER Study evaluated the prevalence of FH in Italian patients with a recent CAD event. METHODS: Eighty-two cardiology centres enrolled patients with a documented CAD event; CV risk profile, drug therapy and biochemical parameters were collected. Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria were used to define patients with a potential FH diagnosis (score \u22656); these patients underwent molecular testing for genetic diagnosis of FH. RESULTS: Overall, 5415 patients were enrolled and the main index events were myocardial infarction with ST-elevation, non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or a recent coronary revascularization (34.8%, 37.2%, and 28% respectively). Mean age was 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 years, men were 78%; about 40% were already treated with statins, proportion that increased after the acute event (96.5%). Based on the DLCN score, the prevalence of potential FH was 5.1%, 0.9% of them had a diagnosis of definite FH (score >8). These patients were younger than patients with a score <6 (56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 vs 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and LDL-C levels were in most of them (~87%) >190\u00a0mg/dL. FH was genetically confirmed in 42 subjects (15.9%); genetic diagnosis was defined as not conclusive for FH in 63 patients (23.9%). Finally, in 159 subjects (60.2%) no pathogenic mutations in the tested genes were identified, defining them as negative for monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore a relatively high prevalence of potential FH in patients with a recent CAD event. Therefore, an early identification of these subjects may help improve the management of their high CV risk and, by cascade screening, identify possible FH relatives.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: with the increasing number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with complex coronary lesion and the increasing needs of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures, there is an increasing need for a tool to perform early stratification in high-risk patients, which can be used in daily clinical practice, even at first-line health care facilities setting in Indonesia. It is expected that early stratification of high-risk patients can reduce morbidity and mortality rate in patients with ACS. This study aimed to identify diagnostic accuracy of platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and the optimum cut-off point of PLR as a screening tool for identifying a complex coronary lesion in patients \u226445 and >45 years old. METHODS: this was a retrospective cross-sectional study, conducted at the ICCU of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Data was obtained from medical records of adult patients with ACS who underwent coronary angiography between January 2012 - July 2015. The inclusion criteria were adult ACS patients (aged \u226518 years old), diagnosed with ACS and underwent coronary angiography during hospitalization. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-). The cut-off point was determined using ROC curve. RESULTS: the proportion of ACS patients with complex coronary lesion in our study was 47.2%. The optimum cut-off point in patients aged \u226445 years was 111.06 with sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR of 91.3%, 91.9%, 11.27 and 0.09, respectively. The optimum cut-off points in patients aged >45 years was 104.78 with sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR of 91.7%, 58.6%, 2.21 and 0.14, respectively. CONCLUSION: the optimum cut-off point for PLR in patients aged \u2264 45 years is 111.06 and for patients with age >45 years is 104.78 with diagnostic accuracy, represented by AUC of 93.9% (p<0.001) and 77.3% (p<0.001), respectively for both age groups.",

This study explores the effectiveness of two recruitment strategies: a screening method in a consecutive help-seeking population entering secondary mental health services for non-psychotic problems vs. a population referred to the diagnostic center of an early-psychosis clinic. METHOD: From February 2008 to February 2010, all general practitioner and self-referrals (aged 18-35 years) to the secondary mental healthcare service in The Hague and Zoetermeer were screened with the Prodromal Questionnaire; patients who scored above the cutoff of 18 and had a decline in social functioning were assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS). All referrals (aged 14-35 years) to the diagnostic center in Amsterdam were also assessed with the CAARMS. RESULTS: The screening detected a three-fold higher prevalence of at-risk mental states: these subjects were older and more often female. manova showed significantly higher scores for the screened population on depression, social anxiety, distress with positive symptoms, and a higher rate of transition to psychosis within 12 months. CONCLUSION: The screening method detects more patients with at-risk mental states than the referral method. The latter method is biased to young male patients in an earlier prodromal stage and a lower transition rate.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Customised individually made (CIM) implants for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were introduced about 10\u00a0years ago. These implants aim to reduce the risk of prosthesis-related issues resulting from anthropometric differences between different knees. The purpose of this study was to analyse the short-term clinical outcome and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) of a specific CIM implant, the ORIGIN\u00ae knee replacement system (Symbios, Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland), which was introduced in 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing primary posterior-stabilised (PS) CIM TKA using the specific ORIGIN\u00ae knee replacement system, (Symbios, Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland). TKAs were performed from February 2019 to October 2020. Data was collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 4 and 12\u00a0months. Outcome measures included the objective part of the Knee Society Score (KSS) with the range of motion (ROM) and the following PROMs: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12), the EuroQol, five dimensions, three levels (EQ-5D-3L) with the EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) and patient satisfaction. Differences in pre- to preoperative data were assessed with paired sample t tests. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Twenty-five CIM TKA (20 patients, 8 female) were included. The mean age at surgery was 66\u00a0years (SD, 6.9). At 4 and 12\u00a0months, significant improvements in the KSS (p\u2009<\u20090.001), the ROM (p\u2009<\u20090.001), all KOOS subscales (p\u2009<\u20090.001), the FJS (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the EQ-5D-3L (p\u2009<\u20090.026) were found. Satisfaction rate was 91% and 88% at 4 and 12\u00a0months, respectively. Intraoperative complications did not occur and no revision surgeries were undertaken. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated significant improvements in the KSS and specific PROMs 1 year after CIM TKA. This study suggests that CIM TKA is a safe and suitable option, which can yield good clinical outcome and PROMs at least during short-term follow-up.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: There is limited data in the literature evaluating outcomes of bariatric surgery in severely obese patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to make them acceptable candidates for heart transplantation. This study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with previously implanted LVAD at our institution. METHODS: All the patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD who underwent LSG from2013 to January 2017 were studied. RESULTS: Seven patients with end stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD were included. The median age and median preoperative BMI were 39\u00a0years (range: 26-62) and 43.6\u00a0kg/m2 (range 36.7-56.7), respectively. The median interval between LVAD implantation and LSG was 38\u00a0months (range 15-48). The median length of hospital stay was 9\u00a0days (rang: 6-23) out of which 4 patients had planned postoperative ICU admission. Thirty-day complications were noted in 5 patients (3 major and 2 minor) without any perioperative mortality. The median duration of follow-up was 24\u00a0months (range 2-30). At the last available follow-up, the median BMI, %EWL, and %TWL were 37\u00a0kg/m2, 47%, and 16%, respectively. The median LVEF before LSG and at the last follow-up point (before heart transplant) was 19% (range 15-20) and 22% (range, 16-35), respectively. In addition, the median NYHA class improved from 3 to 2 after LSG. Three patients underwent successful heart transplantations. CONCLUSION: Patients with morbid obesity, ESHF, and implanted LVAD constitute a high-risk cohort. Our results with 7 patients and result from other studies (19 patients) suggested that bariatric surgery may be a reasonable option for LVAD patients with severe obesity. Bariatric surgery appears to provide significant weight loss in these patients and may improve candidacy for heart transplantation.",

        "a": "Many existing metrics, such as Injury Severity Score (ISS), cannot fully describe many trauma patients because of comorbidities. This study developed and evaluated the Need For Trauma Intervention (NFTI) metric as a novel indicator of major trauma. The NFTI metric was developed from an analysis of 2,396 trauma patients at a Level I trauma center. Six commonly recorded registry variables were found to be indicative of major trauma and comprised the NFTI criteria: receiving packed red blood cells within 4 hr; discharge from the emergency department (ED) to the operating room within 90 min; discharge from the ED to interventional radiology; discharge from the ED to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an ICU length of stay (LOS) of 3 or more days; mechanical ventilation outside of procedural anesthesia within 3 days; or death within 60 hr. Patients meeting any NFTI criteria are classified as having major traumas and, therefore, needing trauma activations (NFTI+). Need For Trauma Intervention was tested in an overlapping sample of 9,737 patients. Being NFTI+ was associated with higher trauma activation levels, older age, higher ISS, worse ED vitals, longer hospital LOS, and mortality. Only 13 of 561 deaths were not NFTI+ and all were in patients with do not resuscitate (DNR) orders; using ISS greater than 15 missed 73 mortalities, 46 with DNR orders. Results suggest that NFTI provides a comprehensive view of both anatomy and physiology in a manner that self-adjusts for age, frailty, and comorbidities as long as care teams adjust their treatments. Need For Trauma Intervention appears to be a unique, simple, and effective tool to retrospectively identify major trauma, regardless of ISS.",

METHODS: Between 2000 and 2003, the pivotal study enrolled patients to open surgery (control) or the Zenith endovascular graft (endovascular). A separate continued access study arm enrolled endovascular patients using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria. Both studies were designed for 2-year follow-up, and the pivotal endovascular patients had the option of extending the study follow-up through 5 years. All endovascular patients were stratified by physiologic risk into high-risk and standard-risk groups to assess overall mortality, rupture, conversion, endoleaks, secondary interventions, and sac enlargement. The entire endovascular cohort was pooled to assess device integrity, limb occlusion, component separation, and migration. The suboptimal endovascular result (SER) was established as an end point to assess late adverse outcomes. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox regression to assess factors contributing to sac enlargement and SER. RESULTS: The study enrolled 739 endovascular patients (352 pivotal, 387 continued access); 158 patients in the pivotal study reconsented to be followed up for 5 years. For the patients at standard and high risk at 5 years, the respective survival estimate was 83% and 61%, aneurysm-related death was 2% and 4%, and freedom from rupture was 100% and 99.6%, respectively. Cumulative risk of conversion, limb occlusion, migration >10 mm, or component separation was < or =3% at 5 years. Cumulative risk of late endoleak was 12% to 15%, representing the primary indication for secondary interventions which occurred in 20% of standard-risk patients and 25% of high-risk patients through 5 years. Sac enlargement was very rare and associated with advanced age and larger aneurysms. SER was predicted by advanced age and internal iliac artery occlusion. CONCLUSION: These middle- and long-term data support long-term durability of the Zenith endovascular graft. Risk of aneurysm-related death or rupture was exceptionally low, and complications of migration, limb occlusion, and device integrity issues were uncommon. Incidence of late endoleaks and association of endoleaks with sac growth underscore the need for long-term follow-up of patients treated with endovascular grafts, although the sequelae of such events are unknown.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Portfolio Diet, or Dietary Portfolio, is a therapeutic dietary pattern that combines cholesterol-lowering foods to manage dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. To translate the Portfolio Diet for primary care, we developed the PortfolioDiet.app as a patient and physician educational and engagement tool for PCs and smartphones. The PortfolioDiet.app is currently being used as an add-on therapy to the standard of care (usual care) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in primary care. To enhance the adoption of this tool, it is important to ensure that the PortfolioDiet.app meets the needs of its target end users. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to undertake user testing to inform modifications to the PortfolioDiet.app as part of ongoing engagement in quality improvement (QI). METHODS: We undertook a 2-phase QI project from February 2021 to September 2021. We recruited users by convenience sampling. Users included patients, family physicians, and dietitians, as well as nutrition and medical students. For both phases, users were asked to use the PortfolioDiet.app daily for 7 days. In phase 1, a mixed-form questionnaire was administered to evaluate the users' perceived acceptability, knowledge acquisition, and engagement with the PortfolioDiet.app. The questionnaire collected both quantitative and qualitative data, including 2 open-ended questions. The responses were used to inform modifications to the PortfolioDiet.app. In phase 2, the System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of the updated PortfolioDiet.app, with a score higher than 70 being considered acceptable. RESULTS: A total of 30 and 19 users were recruited for phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. In phase 1, the PortfolioDiet.app increased users' perceived knowledge of the Portfolio Diet and influenced their perceived food choices. Limitations identified by users included challenges navigating to resources and profile settings, limited information on plant sterols, inaccuracies in points, timed-logout frustration, request for step-by-step pop-up windows, and request for a mobile app version; when looking at positive feedback, the recipe section was the most commonly praised feature. Between the project phases, 6 modifications were made to the PortfolioDiet.app to incorporate and address user feedback. At phase 2, the average System Usability Scale score was 85.39 (SD 11.47), with 100 being the best possible. CONCLUSIONS: By undertaking user testing of the PortfolioDiet.app, its limitations and strengths were able to be identified, informing modifications to the application, which resulted in a clinical tool that better meets users' needs. The PortfolioDiet.app educates users on the Portfolio Diet and is considered acceptable by users. Although further refinements to the PortfolioDiet.app will continue to be made before its evaluation in a clinical trial, the result of this QI project is an improved clinical tool.",

The primary endpoint was the need for additional uterotonic medication. METHODS: Each of the five participating Dutch hospitals treated 50-100 term patients with 100 \u03bcg of intravenous carbetocin on prescription. Each centre retrieved charts of 250 patients treated with oxytocin according to the hospital's policy for the prevention of uterine atony (oxytocin bolus 5 IU, bolus 10 IU or bolus 5 IU followed by 10 IU in 2 h). RESULTS: In the carbetocin group 462 subjects were included and in the oxytocin group 1,122. The proportion of subjects needing additional uterotonic treatment was 3.1 % (95 % CI 1.7-5.1 %) after carbetocin and 7.2 % (5.8-8.9 %) after oxytocin; relative risk 0.41 (0.19-0.85); p = 0.0110. Carbetocin was most effective compared with the oxytocin 5 IU bolus subgroup with less need for additional uterotonic medication (3.1 vs. 9.3 %, p = 0.0067) and blood transfusions (2.2 vs. 3.6 %, p = 0.0357). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with oxytocin, prophylaxis of uterine atony with carbetocin after an elective CS diminished the need for additional uterotonics by more than 50 %.",

In daily practice, we have occasionally encountered spontaneous regression of airspace opacities (SRAs) without treatment on serial CTs in patients with IMAs, which has not previously been described in the literature. Here, we describe serial CT findings with emphasis on SRAs in relation to clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes in patients with IMAs. METHODS: A total of 46 patients with pathologically-confirmed IMAs of the lung from January 2013 to June 2018 were included. Serial CT scans were reviewed and the patients were classified into SRA and no-SRA groups according to the presence of SRA. Radiological features, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were compared between the SRA and no-SRA groups. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included in the no-SRA group and 14 patients in the SRA group. IMAs in the SRA group were mostly pneumonic (P <\u20090.001), larger (P <\u20090.001), multifocal (P =\u20090.001), and showed higher stage (P <\u20090.001) on initial CT. Of seven patients who died during follow-up, six were from the SRA group (P <\u20090.001). Mean overall survival for all IMAs was 86.6 months (range, 0-110\u2009months), and the SRA group showed significantly worse overall survival (P <\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS: IMAs of the lung showing SRAs on serial CTs are larger and multifocal, and tend to be pneumonic in type on initial CT. Patients present at a higher stage of disease, with higher mortality rate and reduced overall survival. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (IMAs) of the lung can show spontaneous regression of airspace opacities (SRAs) on serial CTs, without being correlated to the administration of anticancer drugs. IMAs that showed SRAs demonstrated reduced overall survival in patients. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: When airspace opacities show regression on CT, IMA should still be included in the differential diagnosis. A more careful application of RECIST 1.1 is needed in the assessment of tumor response of IMAs.",

Present study profiled patients admitted to PICU and determined PIM2 score applicability in Indian setting. Patients and Methods. Prospective observational study. Results. In 742 consecutive admissions, male\u2009:\u2009female ratio was 1.5\u2009:\u20091, 35.6% patients were ventilated, observed mortality was 7%, and 26.4% were <1 year. The profile included septicemia and septic shock (29.6%), anemia (27.1%), pneumonia (19.6%), and meningitis and encephalitis (17.2%). For the first year, sensitivity of PIM2 was 65.8% and specificity was 71% for cutoff value at 1.9 by ROC curve analysis. The area under the curve was 0.724 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.76). This cutoff was validated for second year data yielding similar sensitivity (70.6%) and specificity (65%). Logistic regression analysis (LRA) over entire data revealed various variables independently associated with mortality along with PIM2 score. Another logistic model with same input variables except PIM2 yielded the same significant variables with Nagelkerke R square of 0.388 and correct classification of 78.5 revealing contribution of PIM2 in predicting mortality is meager. Conclusion. Infectious diseases were the commonest cause of PICU admission and mortality. PIM2 scoring did not explain the outcome adequately, suggesting need for recalibration. Following PALS/GEM guidelines was associated with better outcome.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with a follow-up of at least 5\u2009years were included. All-cause death was the primary endpoint. MACCE [a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and repeat revascularization] along with its single components and cardiovascular (CV) death were the secondary ones. Analyses were stratified according to the use of first- vs. last-generation coronary stents. Subgroup comparisons were performed according to SYNTAX score (below or above 33) and to age (using cut-offs of each trial's subgroup analysis). Four RCTs with 4394 patients were identified: 2197 were treated with CABG, 657 with first generation, and 1540 with last-generation stents. At 5-year rates of all-cause death did not differ [odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.21], as those of CV death and stroke. Coronary artery bypass graft reduced rates of MACCE (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79), mainly driven by MI (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65) and revascularization (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.64). Benefit of CABG for MACCE was consistent, although with different extent, across values of SYNTAX score (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97 for values\u2009<\u200932 and OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.84 for values\u2009\u2265\u200933) while was not evident for 'younger' patients (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65-1.07 vs. OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.84 for 'older' patients). CONCLUSION: For patients with ULM disease followed-up for 5 years, no significant difference was observed in all-cause and cardiovascular death between PCI and CABG. Coronary artery bypass graft reduced risk of MI, revascularization, and MACCE especially in older patients and in those with complex coronary disease and a high SYNTAX score.",

        "a": "Making sure that anaesthetic equipment is working correctly is an essential part of the anaesthetic practitioner's role. During induction of anaesthesia the patient is at one of the most vulnerable points in his or her perioperative journey. This is the point at which equipment error may put the patient at high risk of harm, for example, through compromising the airway, causing circulatory problems, preventing satisfactory oxygenation or even causing death. Many writers have drawn comparisons between anaesthesia and aviation, with the suggestion that practitioners should check the anaesthetic machines using a 'cockpit drill' (Ranasinghe 2000). The purpose of this detailed check is to ensure the machine is safe to use. The careful attention to the check is a reflection of good practice which the practitioner's codes of professional practice demand (HPC 2004, NMC 2004).

        "a": "The early prediction of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important for several purposes, but no prognostic models have yet been developed with proven generalizability across different settings. The objective of this study was to develop and validate prognostic models that use information available at admission to estimate 6-month outcome after severe or moderate TBI. To this end, this study evaluated mortality and unfavorable outcome, that is, death, and vegetative or severe disability on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), at 6 months post-injury. Prospectively collected data on 2269 patients from two multi-center clinical trials were used to develop prognostic models for each outcome with logistic regression analysis. We included seven predictive characteristics-age, motor score, pupillary reactivity, hypoxia, hypotension, computed tomography classification, and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The models were validated internally with bootstrapping techniques. External validity was determined in prospectively collected data from two relatively unselected surveys in Europe (n = 796) and in North America (n = 746). We evaluated the discriminative ability, that is, the ability to distinguish patients with different outcomes, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Further, we determined calibration, that is, agreement between predicted and observed outcome, with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The models discriminated well in the development population (AUC 0.78-0.80). External validity was even better (AUC 0.83-0.89). Calibration was less satisfactory, with poor external validity in the North American survey (p < 0.001). Especially, observed risks were higher than predicted for poor prognosis patients. A score chart was derived from the regression models to facilitate clinical application. Relatively simple prognostic models using baseline characteristics can accurately predict 6-month outcome in patients with severe or moderate TBI. The high discriminative ability indicates the potential of this model for classifying patients according to prognostic risk.",

Secondarily, to consider the burn-related risk factors, demographics, incidence, and mortality for ARDS in this population. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review; ARDS defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference and the Lung Injury Severity Score definitions. SETTING: Regional, tertiary referral, adult burn unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with thermal injury requiring mechanical ventilation, admitted between 1 January 1991 and 28 February 1995. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of 469 consecutive admissions, 126 (26.9%) received intubation and mechanical ventilation. ARDS was defined according to the American-European Consensus and Lung Injury Severity Score (score > 2.5) definitions. The mean time to onset of ARDS from admission to the burn unit was 6.9 +/- 5.2 and 8.2 +/- 10.7 days when defined by the American-European Consensus and Lung Injury Severity Score definitions respectively (p = 0.41). Of the intubated patients, 53.6 and 45.2% developed ARDS according to the American-European Consensus and Lung Injury Severity Score definitions, respectively (p = 0.19). Using multivariate logistic analysis, only age proved to be an independent risk factor for the development of ARDS (p = 0.03), although there was a trend toward an increased incidence of inhalation injury in patients with ARDS. Mortality was not significantly greater (41.8 vs 32.2%) in those with ARDS compared to those without (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: According to the American-European Consensus Conference and the Lung Injury Severity Score definitions, ARDS is common in the adult burn population and has a delayed onset compared to most critical care populations. We found age to be a major predisposing factor for ARDS.",

METHODS: From 1988 to 2001, 538 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Patient age at surgery, clinical stage, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score of positive biopsies were noted. Postoperatively, specimen weight, final Gleason score, and capsular, seminal vesicle, and lymph node status, as well as tumor volume, were studied. The incidence and location of positive margins and the pathologic stage were noted according to the surgical approach. RESULTS: A total of 371 patients (69.5%) had organ-confined tumors. Of the 371 patients, 116 underwent the retropubic, 86 the perineal, and 169 the laparoscopic approach, and positive surgical margins were noted in 22 (18.9%), 12 (13.9%), and 32 (18.9%) patients, respectively. Positive surgical margins were reported in 72 specimen locations, 32 (44.4%) at the apex, 17 (23.6%) at the bladder neck, and 29 (31.9%) posterolaterally.

CONCLUSIONS: In our series, each approach had a specific high-risk location of positive margins: the apex for the retropubic, the bladder neck for the perineal, and posterolaterally for the laparoscopic approach.

In patients with cirrhosis, over-hydration is a common feature but its prognostic value has not been evaluated. This study examines the independent prognostic significance of MELD, serum sodium and hydration status on long-term survival in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Serum sodium and hydration (total body water as a percentage of fat-free mass) were measured in 227 consecutive cirrhotic patients (146 male, 81 female; median age 49 years, range 19-73 years; median MELD score 13, range 6-36). Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or listed for liver transplantation at the time of initial assessment were excluded. A competing risks Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of MELD, sodium and hydration on risk of death or transplant. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 52 (range 4-93) months. Serum sodium and hydration were each associated with reduction in time to death or transplant on univariate analysis (sodium: hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.94, P < 0.0001; hydration: HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.30, P < 0.0001).

In this retrospective single-center study, we investigated early morbidity and mortality following BSTKA in a modern fast-track setting. We also identified risk factors for re-admission within 90 days and for a length of stay (LOS) of more than 5 days. Patients and methods - 284 patients were selected to receive BSTKA at our institution from 2008 through 2014 in a well-described, standardized fast-track setup (Husted 2012a, b). All re-admissions within 90 days were identified and mortality rates and time until death were recorded. Transfusion rates and numbers of transfusions were also recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for re-admission within 90 days, and also for a LOS of more than 5 days. Results - 90-day mortality was 0%. 10% of the patients were re-admitted within 90 days. Median time to re-admission was 18 (3-75) days. 153 patients (54%) received postoperative blood transfusions. An ASA score of 3 was identified as an independent risk factor for re-admission within 90 days (OR = 5, 95% CI: 1.3-19) and for LOS of > 5 days (OR = 6, 95% CI: 1.6-21). Higher BMI was a weak risk factor for re-admission within 90 days. Interpretation - BSTKA in selected patients without cardiopulmonary disease in a fast-track setting appears to be safe with respect to early postoperative morbidity and mortality. Surgeons should be aware that patients with an ASA score of 3 have an increased risk of re-admission and a prolonged length of stay, while patients with higher BMI have an increased risk of re-admission following BSTKA.",

        "a": "Contralateral carotid stenosis (clCS) has been described as a perioperative predictor of mortality after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, its predictive value on long-term cardiovascular events remains controversial. The study aims to assess the potential role of clCS as a long-term predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients who underwent CEA. From January 2012 to July 2020, patients undergoing CEA under regional anesthesia for carotid stenosis in a tertiary care and referral center were eligible from a prospective database, and a post hoc analysis was performed. The primary outcome consisted in the occurrence of long-term MACE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, and major adverse limb events. A total of 192 patients were enrolled. With a median 50 months follow-up, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (mean survival time (MST) 51.7 vs. 103.3, P < 0.010) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) (MST 75.1 vs. 90.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were associated with decreased survival time. After propensity score matching (PSM), CKD (MST 49.1 vs. 106.0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and PAD (MST 75.7 vs. 94.0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) maintained this association. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, contralateral stenosis was associated with higher MACE (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a02.035; 95% CI: 1.113-3.722, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021 and all-cause mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.564; 95% CI: 1.276-5,152 P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). After PSM, only all-cause mortality (HR 2.323; 95% CI: 0.993-5.431, P\u00a0=\u00a00.052) maintained a significant association with clCS. On multivariable analysis, clCS (aHR 2.367; 95% CI: 1.174-4.771, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), age (aHR 1.039, 95% CI: 1.008-1.070), CKD (aHR 2.803; 95% CI: 1.409-5.575, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and PAD (aHR 3.225, 95% CI: 1.695-6.137, P < 0.001) were independently associated with increased all-cause mortality. Contrary to MACE, clCS is a strong predictor of long-term all-cause mortality after CEA. However, MACE risk may compromise CEA benefits by other competitive events. Therefore, further studies are needed to establish the role of clCS on postoperative events and on patients' specific assessments in order to determine the best medical treatment and easy access to surgical intervention.",

Moreover, the combination of MD and global longitudinal strain (GLS) increased the prediction of arrhythmic events. We investigated the prognostic value of a new 2-dimensional strain index, GLS/MD, in patients with heart failure (HF). We analyzed 340 consecutive HF outpatients in sinus rhythm. Echocardiography was performed at 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 months after hospital discharge. The end point included sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation, and sustained ventricular tachycardia (SCD/VA). During the follow-up period (36 \u00b1 9 months), SCD/VA occurred in 48 patients (14.1%). A multivariate Cox regression analysis, which included LVEF, early diastolic transmitral / mitral annular velocity ratio (E/E'), GLS, MD, and GLS/MD in the model, revealed that GLS/MD was the best independent predictor of SCD/VA (HR = 3.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.72-6.15, p = 0.03). Separate inclusion of LVEF, systolic mitral annular velocity, E/E', GLS, and MD together with GLS/MD showed that GLS/MD remained the best predictor of SCD/VA (each p < 0.05). The optimal GLS/MD cutoff value to predict SCA/VA was -0.20%/ms (80% sensitivity, 76% specificity). Irrespective of LVEF, free survival was significantly better in patients with GLS/MD \u2264 -0.2%/ms (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

We aimed to investigate associations between subjects' exercise habits and the risk of metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study analyzed subjects older than 40\u2009years who received screening colonoscopy with polypectomy and surveillance colonoscopy between January 2009 and December 2016. All participants completed a standard questionnaire containing exercise habits before surveillance colonoscopy. Subjects' exercise habits were quantified as weekly exercise amounts (metabolic equivalents of task-day/week) and dichotomized (active/sedentary exercise habit) using averages as the cut-off point. The associations between incidence of metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasm and exercise habits were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1820 subjects comprised the study cohort and 86 (4.73%) of them developed metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasm during the surveillance period. An active exercise habit after polypectomy was associated with a lower risk of metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasm (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u20090.35-0.91). Furthermore, this protective effect from exercise was specific for subjects having advanced neoplasm at screening colonoscopy (aHR 0.32, 95% CI\u20090.11-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: An active exercise habit after polypectomy, a surrogate for a more active lifestyle, is associated with a lower risk for developing metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasm. A positive lifestyle modification, such as maintaining/establishing an active exercise habit, should be advised after polypectomy, especially for those with advanced colorectal neoplasm during screening.",

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Patients were classified as having either low, normal, or high eGFR based on the 5th and 95th percentiles of age- and sex-specific quintiles for eGFR. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated GHF as an independent predictor of postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 120,013 patients were eligible for analysis, of which 1706 (1.4%) were identified as having GHF, with a median eGFR of 105.37\u00a0ml/min per 1.73 m2 (IQR 94.84-116.77). Compared to patients with normal eGFR, patients with GHF were older (68\u00a0years, [IQR 60-71], p\u2009<\u20090.001), had a lower BMI (27.52\u00a0kg/m2 [IQR 23.71-31.95], p\u2009<\u20090.001), and greater 5-item modified frailty index scores (\u2265\u20091, 70.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that GHF was associated with greater odds of any complication (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.40, p\u2009=\u20090.002), non-home discharge (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.50-2.30, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and prolonged LOS (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: GHF is associated with greater odds of 30-day complications following major urologic oncology surgery.",

There are few studies about the epidemiology of osteoporosis in Egypt, in addition, there was no study done before to evaluate the performance of these seven screening tools in a large sample size. This aims to help clinicians restrict the use of DXA scan for those patients defined as \"high risk\" for osteoporosis which can substantially reduce the cost for the community and the patients, especially in developing countries. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 681 elderly women for measurement of BMD using DXA scans. The performance of the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE) was superior to other indices with the highest sensitivity and specificity. The newly modified SCORE tool at cutoff point \u22651 is a simple easy tool and shows good sensitivity (up to 94%) and acceptable specificity (up to 46.7%) in detecting osteoporosis in elderly women with fewer items and easier calculation.",

        "a": "In various tumors, epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) serves a role in tumorigenesis and has an impact on survival. Usually the EGF-receptor is located on the surface of the cell membrane and is involved in various signaling pathways. The dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB family proteins, such as HER2, is important for the tumor progression. Nevertheless, a second EGFR-associated signaling pathway appears to be important for tumor cells, which is cytoplasmic/nuclear EGFR. The present study examined the influence of membranous or cytoplasmic localized EGFR on the prognosis of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Slides from 45 OSCC tumor samples were stained against EGFR using immunohistochemistry and analysed by the Remmele score system. The association with histopathological parameters and survival data was analyzed. Cytoplasmatic EGFR localization was identified as an independent predictive biomarker for overall survival in the examined OSCC cohort according to multivariate Cox regression analysis. Positive cytoplasmatic EGFR staining was correlated with a higher risk of early death (RR=3.0; P=0.035), while membranous EGFR localization did not affect patient survival. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study to demonstrate that cytoplasmatic-localized EGFR is an independent prognostic biomarker for the overall survival of patients with OSCC.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Early intervention with self-management strategies can potentially reduce the risk of progression of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). OBJECTIVE: To determine if The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow (TOLF) program focused on self-management strategies applied to patients with a subclinical or mild stage of BCRL can improve lymphedema-related behaviors, symptom experience, and limb circumference changes. METHODS: A total of 41 women with subclinical or mild lymphedema were enrolled in TOLF program. Lymphedema-related behaviors and lymphedema-related symptom experiences were measured by the Breast Cancer and Lymphedema Symptom Experience Index, and limb circumference changes were measured by sequential circumferential limb measurements at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the effects of the intervention on outcomes. RESULTS: Generalized estimating equations revealed that lymphedema-related behaviors and the number and severity of lymphedema-related symptoms were significantly improved at 4 postintervention test points compared with baseline (all P < .001). Reduced lymphedema-related symptom distress in functional, social, emotional, and psychological and self-perception (all P < .01) also resulted. The majority (77.5%) of patients maintained their preintervention lymphedema status; 17.5% of them reversed from mild lymphedema to subclinical lymphedema; 5.0% of them had lymphedema status progression. CONCLUSION: Positive outcomes in terms of lymphedema-related behaviors, relieving lymphedema-related symptom experience, and halting the progression of lymphedema status were documented following TOLF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses could educate patients to incorporate the self-management strategies of TOLF program into daily life to help patients prevent or reverse subclinical or mild stage of BCRL.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Assess the cardiovascular safety of Thiazolidinediones (TZD) in routine clinical practice. BACKGROUND: TZD are insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic drugs commonly used in type 2 diabetes, but their cardiovascular safety has been questioned. We examined the association between TZD use and major cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: We examined 2-year mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and congestive heart failure (CHF) rates among outpatients with high cardiovascular risk and diabetes according to TZD use in the REACH Registry. Multivariable adjustment and propensity scores were used in the analyses. RESULTS: A total of 4997 out of 28,332 patients took TZDs at baseline. During follow-up, 1532 patients died. The mortality rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 6.5% (5.5-7.6) with TZD and 7.2% (6.33-8.06) without; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.06 (0.89-1.26, P=0.54). The lack of association with mortality was consistent across subgroups regardless of history of atherothrombosis or CHF. Rates of non-fatal MI (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83-1.45, P=0.50) and non-fatal CHF (HR 0.90, CI 0.75-1.09, P=0.27) were similar in users and non-users. TZD use was associated with an increased risk of CHF in patients aged >80 years (HR 1.59, CI 1.06-2.40, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Use of TZD was not associated with increased incidence of major cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes from this large registry. Older patients experienced an increased risk of CHF over the study interval. Limitations of this study include its observational design, and thus unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded.",

Elevated serum troponin (TN) levels are strongly predictive of posttransplant mortality after kidney transplantation. We sought to determine whether pretransplant TN levels were predictive of mortality and graft loss after liver transplantation in 236 liver transplant recipients from 1998 to 2001 with 8.2 years of follow-up. Elevated TN levels [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, P = 0.004] and a pretransplant history of cardiovascular disease (CVD; HR = 1.90, P = 0.031) were predictive of patient mortality. Elevated TN levels (HR = 2.44, P < 0.001), a history of CVD (HR = 1.83, P = 0.031), and a combination of elevated TN levels and CVD (HR = 2.75, P = 0.027) were associated with increased graft loss. Multivariate analysis confirmed TN and CVD as independent predictors of mortality and graft loss. CVD (HR = 2.39, P = 0.032) and a combination of elevated TN levels and a history of CVD (HR = 6.67, P < 0.001) were predictive of graft loss within 1 year. Age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, creatinine levels, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores were not predictive of posttransplant mortality or graft loss. In summary, elevated pretransplant serum TN levels are strongly predictive of mortality and graft loss after liver transplantation and may be helpful in risk stratification of potential liver transplant recipients.",

        "a": "Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have poor prognoses and low overall survival (OS) rates owing to its heterogeneity and the complexity of its tumour microenvironment (TME). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a key role in the initiation and progression of haematopoietic malignancies. However, the underlying function of m6A regulators in AML remains elusive. This study thoroughly analysed the m6A modification features of 177 AML patients based on 22 m6A regulators. Utilizing unsupervised clustering, we determined three distinct m6A modification patterns related to different biological functions, TME cell-infiltrating characteristics and clinical outcomes. Additionally, a risk score was constructed based on six m6A regulators-associated prognostic signatures and was validated as an independent and valuable prognostic factor for AML. Patients with a low-risk score exhibited better survival than those with a high-risk score. Many m6A regulators were aberrantly expressed in AML, among which METTL14, YTHDC2, ZC3H13 and RBM15 were observed to be associated with the OS of AML. In addition, these four m6A regulators were found to be noticeably related to the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments. Finally, we verified the expression levels of these four m6A regulators in AML and healthy samples and three groups of AML patients with different risk categories. Collectively, our study indicates that the m6A modification pattern is involved in TME immune-infiltrating characteristics and prognosis in AML. A better understanding of the m6A modification pattern will help enhance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of AML and develop potential prognosis prediction indicators and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Very little is known about the identity of genetic factors involved in the complex etiology of nonsyndromic neural tube defects (NTD). Potential susceptibility genes have emerged from the vast number of mutant mouse strains displaying NTD. Reasonable candidates are the human homologues of mice exencephaly genes Tfap2alpha and Msx2, which are expressed in the developing neural tube. METHODS: A single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) mutation screen of the coding sequences of TFAP2alpha and MSX2 was performed for 204 nonsyndromic NTD patients including cases of anencephaly (n = 10), encephalocele (n = 8), and spina bifida aperta, SBA (n = 183). A selected number of SBA patients was additionally tested for specific mutations in MTHFD, FRalpha, and PAX1 already shown to be related to NTD. RESULTS: Two TFAP2alpha point mutations in individual SBA patients were silent on the amino acid level (C308C, T396T). On nucleic acid level, these mutations change evolutionary conserved codons and thus may influence mRNA processing and translation efficiency. One SBA patient displayed an exonic 9-bp deletion in MSX2 leading to a shortened and possibly less functional protein. None of these mutations was found in 222 controls. Seven polymorphisms detected in TFAP2alpha and MSX2 were equally distributed in patients and controls. Patients with combined heterozygosity of an exonic MSX2 and an intronic TFAP2alpha polymorphism were at a slightly increased risk of NTD (OR 1.71; 95% CI 0.57-5.39). CONCLUSIONS: Although several new genetic variants were found in TFAP2 and MSX2, no statistically significant association was found between NTD cases and the new alleles or their combinations. Further studies are necessary to finally decide if these gene variants may have acted as susceptibility factors in our individual cases.",

Modified versions of the ACCP, VTE-BLEED, and HAS-BLED scores help identify patients with unprovoked VTE who are at high risk of major bleeding and should be considered for discontinuation of anticoagulation after 3 to 6 months of initial treatment.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The standard busulfan-cyclophosphamide myeloablative conditioning regimen is associated with substantial non-relapse mortality in patients older than 40 years with acute myeloid leukaemia who are undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Because the combination of busulfan plus fludarabine has been proposed to reduce non-relapse mortality, we aimed to compare this treatment with busulfan plus cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen in these patients. METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia at 25 hospital transplant centres in Italy and one in Israel. Eligible patients were aged 40-65 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than 3, and were in complete remission. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide or busulfan plus fludarabine. Treatment allocations were not masked to investigators or patients. Randomisation was done centrally via a dedicated web-based system using remote data entry, with patients stratified by donor type and complete remission status. Patients allocated to busulfan plus cyclophosphamide received intravenous busulfan 0\u00b78 mg/kg four times per day during 2 h infusions for four consecutive days (16 doses from days -9 through -6; total dose 12\u00b78 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg per day for two consecutive days (on days -4 and -3; total dose 120 mg/kg). Patients allocated to busulfan plus fludarabine received the same dose of intravenous busulfan (from days -6 through -3) and fludarabine at 40 mg/m(2) per day for four consecutive days (from days -6 through -3; total dose 160 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint was 1-year non-relapse mortality, which was assessed on an intention-to-treat basis; safety outcomes were assessed in the per-protocol population. This trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01191957. FINDINGS: Between Jan 3, 2008, and Dec 20, 2012, we enrolled and randomly assigned 252 patients to receive busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (n=125) or busulfan plus fludarabine (n=127). Median follow-up was 27\u00b75 months (IQR 9\u00b78-44\u00b73). 1-year non-relapse mortality was 17\u00b72% (95% CI 11\u00b76-25\u00b74) in the busulfan plus cyclophosphamide group and 7\u00b79% (4\u00b73-14\u00b73) in the busulfan plus fludarabine group (Gray's test p=0\u00b7026). The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher adverse events were gastrointestinal events (28 [23%] of 121 patients in the busulfan plus cyclophosphamide group and 26 [21%] of 124 patients in the busulfan plus fludarabine group) and infections (21 [17%] patients in the busulfan plus cyclophosphamide group and 13 [10%] patients in the busulfan plus fludarabine group had at least one such event). INTERPRETATION: In older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, the myeloablative busulfan plus fludarabine conditioning regimen is associated with lower transplant-related mortality than busulfan plus cyclophosphamide, but retains potent antileukaemic activity. Accordingly, this regimen should be regarded as standard of care during the planning of allogeneic transplants for such patients. FUNDING: Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Displaced femoral neck fractures usually are treated with hemiarthroplasty. However, the degree to which the design of the implant used (cemented or uncemented) affects the outcome is not known and may be therapeutically important. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this randomized controlled trial, we sought to compare cemented with cementless fixation in bipolar hemiarthroplasties at 5 years in terms of (1) Harris hip scores; (2) femoral fractures; (3) overall health outcomes using the Barthel Index and EQ-5D scores; and (4) complications, reoperations, and mortality since our earlier report on this cohort at 1-year followup. METHODS: We present followup at a median of 5 years after surgery (range, 56-65 months) from a randomized trial comparing a cemented hemiarthroplasty (112 hips) with an uncemented, hydroxyapatite-coated hemiarthroplasty (108 hips), both with a bipolar head. Results were previously reported at 1-year followup. Harris hip scores, Barthel Index, and EQ-5D scores were assessed by one research nurse and one orthopaedic surgeon. Complications and reoperations were determined by chart review and radiographs examined by three orthopaedic surgeons. Sixty patients (56%) had died in the cemented group and 63 (60%) in the uncemented group. Respectively, three and two patients (2.7% and 1.9%) were completely lost to followup. RESULTS: Harris hip scores at 5 years were higher in the uncemented group than in the cemented group (86.2 versus 76.3; mean difference 9.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-17.9). The prevalence of postoperative periprosthetic femoral fractures was 7.4% in the uncemented group and 0.9% in the cemented group (hazard ratio [HR], 9.3; 95% CI, 1.16-74.5). Barthel Index and EQ-5D scores were not different between the groups. Between 1 and 5 years, we found no additional infections or dislocations. The mortality rate was not different between the groups (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.82-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Both arthroplasties may be used with good medium-term results after displaced femoral neck fractures.

        "t": "Evaluation and Comparison of Different Prehospital Triage Scores of Trauma Patients on In-Hospital Mortality.",
        "a": "Introduction: Several prehospital major trauma patient triage scores have been developed, the triage revised trauma score (T-RTS), Vittel criteria, Mechanism/Glasgow Coma Scale/Age/Systolic blood pressure score (MGAP), and the new trauma score (NTS). These scoring schemes allow a rapid and accurate prognostic assessment of the severity of potential lesions. The aim of our study was to compare these scores with in-hospital mortality predictions in a cohort of consecutive trauma patients admitted in a Level 1 trauma center. Materials: Between 2013 and 2016, 1,112 patients were admitted to the \"major trauma\" spinneret of a Level 1 trauma center in the south of France. All prehospital data needed to calculate the T-RTS, Vittel criteria, the MGAP score, and the NTS were collected. The main evaluation criterion was in-hospital mortality at 30 days for all causes. The predictive performances of these scores were evaluated and compared with each other using the analysis of the receiver operating curves. Results: A total of 1,001 patients were included in the analysis, 238 (24%) females, aged 43\u2009\u00b1\u200919 years with ISS 15\u2009\u00b1\u200913. The area under the curve was for each score: T-RTS, AUC = 0.84, [0.82-0.87]; Vittel criteria, AUC = 0.87 [0.85-0.89]; MGAP score, AUC = 0.91 [0.89-0.92] and NTS, AUC = 0.90 [0.88-0.92]. By comparing the ROC curves of these scores, the MGAP and NTS scores were statistically higher than the T-RTS. With the current thresholds, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of these scores were 91%, 35%, 10%, 98% for T-RTS, 100%, 2%, 8%, 100% for Vittel criteria, 91%, 71%, 24%, 99% for MGAP score, 82%, 86%, 33%, 98% for NTS. Only Vittel's criteria allowed undertriage below 5% as recommended by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT). Conclusion: The comparison of these different triage scores concluded with a superiority of the MGAP and NTS scores compared with the T-RTS. Including the calculation of MGAP or NTS scores with the Vittel criteria would reduce the risk of overtriage in the Level 1 trauma centers by further directing patients at low risk of death to a lower-level trauma facility.",

        "a": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) comprises around 6% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) diagnoses. In younger patients, age less than 60 to 65 years, aggressive induction often followed by consolidation with autologous stem cell transplant has suggested improved outcomes in this population. Less intensive therapies in older patients often followed by maintenance have been studied or are under active investigation. However, despite recent advances, MCL remains incurable, with a median overall survival of around five years. Patients with high-risk disease have particularly poor outcomes. Treatment varies widely across institutions, and to date no randomized trials comparing intensive vs less intensive approaches have been reported. Although recent data have highlighted the heterogeneity of MCL outcomes, patient assessment for treatment selection has largely been driven by patient age with little regard to fitness, disease biology, or disease risk. One critical advance is the finding that minimal residual disease status (MRD) after induction correlates with long-term outcomes. As such, its use as a potential end point could inform clinical trial design. In order to more rapidly improve the outcomes of MCL patients, clinical trials are needed that prospectively stratify patients on the basis of MCL biology and disease risk, incorporate novel agents, and use MRD to guide the need for additional therapy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevated bleeding and ischemic outcomes. We aim to assess the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of bivalirudin compared to heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with CKD. METHODS: Randomized trials were searched in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases up to January 2017. Among the trials retrieved, efficacy endpoints were defined as mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Safety endpoints were reported as non-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related major bleeding and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each outcome using a fixed effect model. RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 3796 patients were included. In short-term follow up (30 days), bivalirudin significantly reduced non-CABG related major bleeding (p=0.0004) and TIMI major bleeding (p=0.007) compared to heparin plus GPIs. No significant differences were observed in rates of mortality, MI, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, and MACEs between the two groups in short- and long-term follow up (6 months to 3 years). In patients with ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) with concurrent CKD, the decreased non-CABG related major bleeding (p=0.04) without increasing ischemic events was also observed after short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Bivalirudin is safer than and as effective as heparin plus GPIs in CAD patients with CKD. (2) Impaired renal function does not affect the safety benefits of bivalirudin. (3) Similar efficacy profiles were identified between the two groups after both short- and long-term follow up in the CAD patients with CKD.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Tension-free hernia repair with polypropylene mesh plug and patch is currently the most popular technique for open inguinal hernioplasty. It is well tolerated by most patients with few complications. Despite these excellent results, late-onset complications may occur. METHODS: An 83-year-old man reported 2 weeks of bloody stool. His medical history was significant for a left open inguinal herniorrhaphy with the mesh plug and patch technique. Barium enema revealed a stenotic segment in the sigmoid colon and multiple diverticulosis. Because a malignant lesion could not be ruled out, the patient underwent an operation. Laparotomy revealed an inflamed sigmoid colon with diverticulosis adherent to a hard tumor, which was mesh plug used for the previous open inguinal hernia repair. After mobilization of the adhesion between the mesh plug tumor and the sigmoid colon, sigmoidectomy was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a case of sigmoid colon diverticulosis adherent to mesh plug migration after open inguinal hernia repair. The potential risk of plug migration should be well understood by the surgeon. To avoid this risk completely, several methods have been proposed such as suturing the plug and patch together, or using an all-in-one design such as the Prolene Hernia System (Johnson and Johnson Co., Tokyo, Japan).",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: To lower the barrier for initiating insulin treatment and obtain adequate glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), new basal insulin preparations with improved pharmacological properties and consequently a lower risk of hypoglycemia are needed. The objective of this trial was to confirm the efficacy and compare the safety of insulin degludec (IDeg) with insulin glargine (IGlar) in a multinational setting with two thirds of subjects enrolled in China. METHODS: This was a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial in 833 subjects with T2DM (48\u00a0% were female, mean age 56\u00a0years, diabetes duration 8\u00a0years), inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized 2:1 to once-daily IDeg (555 subjects) or IGlar (278 subjects), both with metformin. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 26\u00a0weeks. RESULTS: The completion rate was high (IDeg 94.2\u00a0%; IGlar 91.4\u00a0%). Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.3 to 7.0\u00a0% in both groups. Estimated treatment difference (ETD) [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI)] IDeg-IGlar in change from baseline was -0.05\u00a0% points [-0.18 to 0.08], confirming the non-inferiority of IDeg to IGlar. The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7.0\u00a0% was 54.2 and 51.4\u00a0% with IDeg and IGlar, respectively (estimated odds ratio [95\u00a0% CI] IDeg/IGlar: 1.14 [0.84 to 1.54]). The mean decrease in fasting plasma glucose, self-measured plasma glucose profiles, and insulin dose were similar between groups. Numerically lower rates of overall (estimated rate ratio [95\u00a0% CI] IDeg/IGlar: 0.80 [0.59 to 1.10]) and nocturnal (0.77 [0.43 to 1.37]) confirmed hypoglycemia were observed with IDeg compared with IGlar. No treatment differences in other safety parameters were found. Subjects were more satisfied with the IDeg device compared with the IGlar device as reflected by the total Treatment Related Impact Measures-Diabetes Device score (ETD [95\u00a0% CI] IDeg-IGlar: 2.2 [0.2 to 4.3]). CONCLUSION: IDeg provided adequate glycemic control non-inferior to IGlar and a tendency for a lower hypoglycemia rate. IDeg is considered suitable for initiating insulin therapy in T2DM patients on OADs requiring intensified treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01849289.",

The aim of this study was to search for associations between serum Pfn1 and a number of parameters in MI patients: symptom onset to PCI time (OPT), myocardial necrosis markers, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, antiplatelet drugs, heparin administration and typical atherosclerosis risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients with type 1 MI (according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction) who were able to precisely determine the time of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria involved conditions potentially altering platelet function. We screened 114 patients and included 65. We assessed serum Pfn1 in three time points: on admission (Pfn1_0), 24 hours post PCI (Pfn1_24) and 48 hours post PCI (Pfn1_48) and correlated it with OPT, cardiac necrosis markers (troponin T, CK, CKMB), TIMI flow in the infarct-related artery, pre-hospital P2Y12-antagonist and heparin administration and known atherosclerosis risk factors. RESULTS: Patients with a shorter OPT had higher Pfn1_0 (838.5 vs. 687.1 pg/ml, p=0.007). Patients with impaired coronary flow post PCI had lower Pfn1_24 (748.2 vs. 925.2 pg/ml, p=0.017) and Pfn1_48 (744.5 vs. 879.8, p=0.031. Pfn1_24 and Pfn1_48 were lower in patients who received a P2Y12 antagonist prior to hospital admission. Diabetic patients presented with lower Pfn1_0 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing Pfn1 in type 1 MI patients in relation to the chosen parameters. Pfn1 may be a biochemical tool to objectify information on OPT in MI patients. We found an association between Pfn1 and post-PCI TIMI flow, antiplatelet drug administration and diabetes mellitus.",

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Preoperative prediction of histologic subtype (mucinous vs nonmucinous) and grade of dysplasia in patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms is challenging. Our group has previously published 2 clinical-molecular nomograms for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) that incorporated both clinical/radiographic features and cyst fluid protein markers (sFASL, CA72-4, MMP9, IL-4). METHODS: This multiinstitutional study enrolled patients who underwent EUS-FNA for a cystic lesion of the pancreas. Treatment recommendations regarding resection were based on standard clinical, radiographic, and endoscopic features. Predicted probabilities of high-risk IPMN (high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) were calculated using the previously developed clinical-molecular nomograms. RESULTS: Cyst fluid was obtained from 100 patients who underwent diagnostic EUS-FNA. Within this group there were 35 patients who underwent resection, and 65 were monitored radiographically. Within the group that underwent resection, 26 had low-risk IPMN or benign non-IPMN lesions, and 9 had high-risk IPMN. Within the surveillance group, no patient progressed to resection or developed cancer after a median follow-up of 12months (range: 0.5-38). Using the clinical/radiographic nomogram alone, 2 out of 9 patients with high-risk IPMN had a predicted probability >0.5. In the clinical-molecular models, 6 of 9 patients in model 1, and 6 of 9 in model 2, had scores >0.5. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study of patients with unknown cyst pathology further demonstrates the importance of cyst fluid protein analysis in the preoperative identification of patients with high-risk IPMN. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine if this model will be useful in clinical practice.",

DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, parallel, open-label, clinical trial comparing COC (30\u2009\u03bcg of ethinylestradiol and 150\u2009\u03bcg of desogestrel) plus spironolactone (100\u2009mg/day) with metformin (850\u2009mg b.i.d.) for one year in women with PCOS (EudraCT2008-004531-38). METHODS: The composite primary outcome included efficacy (amelioration of hirsutism, androgen excess and menstrual dysfunction) and cardiometabolic safety (changes in the frequencies of disorders of glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia and hypertension). A complete anthropometric, biochemical, hormonal and metabolic evaluation was conducted every three months and data were submitted to intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were assigned to COC plus spironolactone and 22 patients to metformin. Compared with metformin, COC plus spironolactone caused larger decreases in hirsutism score (mean difference 4.6 points, 95% CI: 2.6-6.7), total testosterone (1.1\u2009nmol/L, 0.4-1.7), free testosterone (25\u2009pmol/L, 12-39), androstenedione (5.5\u2009nmol/L, 1.8-9.2) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (2.7\u2009\u03bcmol/L, 1.4-4.0). Menstrual dysfunction was less frequent with COC plus spironolactone (OR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02-0.23). No differences were found in frequencies of abnormal glucose tolerance (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.7-4.4), dyslipidemia (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.8) or hypertension (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.5-2.0).

Methods: A targeted literature review (TLR) to identify epidemiological evidence (prevalence, incidence, mortality, survival), and systematic literature review (SLR) to identify cost and HCRU data published since January 2016, were performed. MEDLINE databases and Embase searches were conducted in January 2021. Key congresses (2019-2020) and bibliographies of relevant SLRs were hand-searched. Two high-quality SLRs were reviewed for additional cost data published between January 2001-2015. Registry and database studies were prioritized for epidemiological evidence. To allow comparison between studies in this publication, only evidence from the US was considered, with costs inflated to the 2020/2021 cost-year and converted to US dollars. Results: Eight studies from the epidemiology TLR, and eighteen from the cost and HCRU SLR, were extracted. Reported ALS incidence in the US was \u223c1.5 per 100,000 person-years, and point prevalence ranged from 3.84-5.56 per 100,000 population. Total US national costs spanned \u223c$212 million-\u223c$1.4 billion USD/year, and variably consisted of direct costs associated with HCRU and indirect costs. Conclusions: The national cost of \u223c$1.02 billion USD/year (estimated using a prevalence of 16,055 cases) best aligns with prevalence estimates found in the TLR (equating to \u223c13,000-18,000 cases). However, large-scale, population-based studies are necessary to precisely assess US epidemiology of ALS and capture all costs needed to inform cost-effectiveness models and resource planning.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Compelling evidence has emerged for the relevance of flow cytometry (FC) in the diagnostic work-up of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but due to technical issues, the erythroid lineage has been under investigated, specifically in the therapeutic context. METHODS: Using the \"no red cell lysis\" method developed to set up the RED-score, we specifically quantified the fraction of CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors in a cohort of 144 MDS patients and studied the correlation with response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in a sub cohort of 63 low-risk MDS patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the previously reported increase in CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors in a subset of MDS patients and demonstrated a strong association between a cut off of CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors \u22653% and ESA response (P\u2009=\u20090.001), independent of red blood cell requirement. From our observations, we hypothesized that a decrease in CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors could be a mechanism of ESA failure. Moreover, the fraction of CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors was correlated with progression-free survival in low-risk MDS patients (P\u2009=\u20090.018). In vitro, we demonstrated in an EPO dependent cell line that CD117/c-KIT expression is necessary for cell survival under EPO stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The quantification of the CD117/c-KIT-expressing erythroid precursors could be proposed as a new theranostic and prognostic marker in MDS treated by ESA. Future studies will be required to determine whether modulating CD117/c-KIT expression and signaling could be used to improve anemia in MDS. \u00a9 2019 International Clinical Cytometry Society.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features of acute intra-operative encephalocele and the proper prophylactic-therapeutic measures for severe craniocerebral injury. METHODS: The clinical data were collected and analyzed for 21 patients with severe head injuries who suffered acute intra-operative encephalocele from June 2008 to May 2010. There were 12 males and 9 females with an age range of 18 - 69 years old. RESULTS: Among these patients, 6 died with a mortality rate of 28.5%. It was lower than that reported in literatures. One patient died post-operatively of severe brain swelling and intracranial infection secondary to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Four patients died of severe craniocerebral injury, brain swelling and brain stem failure. And 1 patient died after his guardian abandoned the treatment. The follow-up period for the remaining 15 surviving patients was 3 - 6 months. According to the Glasgow outcome score (GOS), there were a favorable prognosis (n = 9), moderate disabilities (n = 5) and severe disability (n = 1). CONCLUSION: The probability of acute intra-operative encephalocele may be predicted in advance with a combination of clinical features and computed tomographic scans. The therapeutic success rate of acute encephalocele will be boosted by taking protective and therapeutic measures pre- and intra-operatively.",

        "a": "AIM: This study aimed to characterize the sociodemographic data, health status, quality of care and 6-year trends in elderly people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study used two French cross-sectional representative surveys of adults of all ages with all types of diabetes (Entred 2001 and 2007), which combined medical claims, and patient and medical provider questionnaires. The 2007 data in patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or over (n=1766) were described and compared with the 2001 data (n=1801). RESULTS: Since 2001, obesity has increased (35% in 2007; +7 points since 2001) while written nutritional advice was less often provided (59%; -6 points). Mean HbA(1c) (7.1%; -0.2%), blood pressure (135/76 mmHg; -4/-3 mmHg) and LDL cholesterol (1.04 g/L; -0.21 g/L) declined, while the use of medication increased: at least two OHAs, 34% (+4 points); OHA(s) and insulin combined, 10% (+4 points); antihypertensive treatment, 83% (+4 points); and statins 48% (+26 points). Severe hypoglycaemia remained frequent (10% had an event at least once a year). The overall prevalence of complications increased. Renal complications were not monitored carefully enough (missing value for albuminuria: 42%; -4.5 points), and 46% of those with a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 were taking metformin. CONCLUSION: Elderly people with type 2 diabetes are receiving better quality of care and have better control of cardiovascular risk factors than before. However, improvement is still required, in particular by performing better screening for complications. In this patient population, it is important to carefully monitor the risks for hypoglycaemia, hypotension, malnutrition and contraindications related to renal function.",

        "a": "Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.The initial STOMP and ORIOLE trial reports suggested that metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) in oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC) was associated with improved treatment outcomes. Here, we present long-term outcomes of MDT in omCSPC by pooling STOMP and ORIOLE and assess the ability of a high-risk mutational signature to risk stratify outcomes after MDT. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. High-risk mutations were defined as pathogenic somatic mutations within ATM, BRCA1/2, Rb1, or TP53. The median follow-up for the whole group was 52.5 months. Median PFS was prolonged with MDT compared with observation (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.66; P value < .001), with the largest benefit of MDT in patients with a high-risk mutation (HR high-risk, 0.05; HR no high-risk, 0.42; P value for interaction: .12). Within the MDT cohort, the PFS was 13.4 months in those without a high-risk mutation, compared with 7.5 months in those with a high-risk mutation (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.11; P = .09). Long-term outcomes from the only two randomized trials in omCSPC suggest a sustained clinical benefit to MDT over observation. A high-risk mutational signature may help risk stratify treatment outcomes after MDT.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between circulating soluble Klotho level and risk of all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using systematic review and meta-analysis technique. METHODS: Potentially eligible studies were identified from Medline and EMBASE databases from inception to March 2020 using a search strategy that consisted of terms for \"Klotho\" and \"Mortality\". Eligible study must be a cohort study that consists of one cohort of CKD patients with higher circulating soluble Klotho level and another cohort of CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level. The study must also report relative risk (RR), incidence rate ratio, hazard risk ratio or standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing all-cause mortality between CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level versus CKD patients with higher circulating soluble Klotho level. If the study divides patients (per circulating soluble Klotho level) into more than two groups, a comparison between the highest and the lowest group would be extracted. Point estimates with standard errors were retrieved from each study and were combined together using the generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: A total of 2964 articles were retrieved. After two rounds of an independent review by two investigators, six prospective cohort studies met the eligibility criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality with the pooled risk ratio of 1.88 (95% CI 1.29-2.74; I2 0%). The funnel plot was fairly symmetric and did not reveal any suggestive evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: The current study found a significant association between lower circulating soluble Klotho level and increased risk of all-cause mortality in CKD patients. However, this meta-analysis carries some limitations, including relatively small sample size, lack of adjustment for potential confounders and between-study heterogeneity in baseline characteristics of the patients and cut-off values used to categorize patients into higher and lower circulating serum Klotho level group.",

The objective of the current review was to assess the clinical and dosimetrical parameters that may predict radiation esophagitis. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed electronic databases. Both prospective and retrospective studies were included. Information regarding clinical and dosimetrical parameters predicting for radiation-induced esophagitis was extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: The esophageal clinical and dosimetric parameters that best predict acute esophagitis remain unclear. In many reports, Vx (the volume of esophagus receiving x Gy) stands out, with values of x ranging from 20-70 Gy. Other studies conclude that the maximal dose received by any point of the esophagus is the best predictor of esophagitis. Another metric implicated with esophageal toxicity in some reports is the proportion of the esophageal circumference or surface area that receives high doses of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements in patient immobilization, setup verification, and radiotherapy delivery are increasingly being employed to limit the toxicity of thoracic irradiation. Future efforts are required to determine how these complex techniques should best be implemented to minimize the risks of acute and long-term esophageal injury.",

        "a": "The transcription factor 4 (TCF4) locus is a robust association finding with schizophrenia (SCZ), but little is known about the genes regulated by the encoded transcription factor. Therefore, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of TCF4 in neural-derived (SH-SY5Y) cells to identify genome-wide TCF4 binding sites, followed by data integration with SCZ association findings. We identified 11\u00a0322 TCF4 binding sites overlapping in two ChIP-seq experiments. These sites are significantly enriched for the TCF4 Ebox binding motif (>85% having \u22651 Ebox) and implicate a gene set enriched for genes downregulated in TCF4 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments, indicating the validity of our findings. The TCF4 gene set was also enriched among (1) gene ontology categories such as axon/neuronal development, (2) genes preferentially expressed in brain, in particular pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex and (3) genes downregulated in postmortem brain tissue from SCZ patients (odds ratio, OR\u2009=\u20092.8, permutation P\u2009<\u20094x10-5). Considering genomic alignments, TCF4 binding sites significantly overlapped those for neural DNA-binding proteins such as FOXP2 and the SCZ-associated EP300. TCF4 binding sites were modestly enriched among SCZ risk loci from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (OR\u2009=\u20091.56, P\u2009=\u20090.03). In total, 130 TCF4 binding sites occurred in 39 of the 108 regions published in 2014. Thirteen genes within the 108 loci had both a TCF4 binding site \u00b110kb and were differentially expressed in siRNA knockdown experiments of TCF4, suggesting direct TCF4 regulation. These findings confirm TCF4 as an important regulator of neural genes and point toward functional interactions with potential relevance for SCZ.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: While the review of radiotherapy treatment plans and charts by a medical physicist is a key component of safe, high-quality care, very few specific recommendations currently exist for this task. AIMS: The goal of TG-275 is to provide practical, evidence-based recommendations on physics plan and chart review for radiation therapy. While this report is aimed mainly at medical physicists, others may benefit including dosimetrists, radiation therapists, physicians and other professionals interested in quality management. METHODS: The scope of the report includes photon/electron external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), proton radiotherapy, as well as high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for gynecological applications (currently the highest volume brachytherapy service in most practices). The following review time points are considered: initial review prior to treatment, weekly review, and end-of-treatment review. The Task Group takes a risk-informed approach to developing recommendations. A failure mode and effects analysis was performed to determine the highest-risk aspects of each process. In the case of photon/electron EBRT, a survey of all American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) members was also conducted to determine current practices. A draft of this report was provided to the full AAPM membership for comment through a 3-week open-comment period, and the report was revised in response to these comments. RESULTS: The highest-risk failure modes included 112 failure modes in photon/electron EBRT initial review, 55 in weekly and end-of-treatment review, 24 for initial review specific to proton therapy, and 48 in HDR brachytherapy. A 103-question survey on current practices was released to all AAPM members who self-reported as working in the radiation oncology field. The response rate was 33%. The survey data and risk data were used to inform recommendations. DISCUSSION: Tables of recommended checks are presented and recommendations for best practice are discussed. Suggestions to software vendors are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: TG-275 provides specific recommendations for physics plan and chart review which should enhance the safety and quality of care for patients receiving radiation treatments.",

This study sought to profile daughters of breast-cancer patients who are likely to return versus those unlikely to return for follow-up care in a high-risk clinic. METHOD: Our investigation included 131 patients attending the UCLA Revlon Breast Center High Risk Clinic. Predictor variables included age, computed breast-cancer risk, participants' perceived personal risk, clinically significant depressive symptomatology (CES-D score \u2265 16), current level of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and survival status of participants' mothers (survived or passed away from breast cancer). RESULTS: A greater likelihood of reattendance was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.07, p = 0.004), computed breast-cancer risk (AOR = 1.10, p = 0.017), absence of depressive symptomatology (AOR = 0.25, p = 0.009), past psychiatric diagnosis (AOR = 3.14, p = 0.029), and maternal loss to breast cancer (AOR = 2.59, p = 0.034). Also, an interaction was found between mother's survival and perceived risk (p = 0.019), such that reattendance was associated with higher perceived risk among participants whose mothers survived (AOR = 1.04, p = 0.002), but not those whose mothers died (AOR = 0.99, p = 0.685). Furthermore, a nonlinear inverted \"U\" relationship was observed between state anxiety and reattendance (p = 0.037); participants with moderate anxiety were more likely to reattend than those with low or high anxiety levels. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors were found to be independently associated with reattendance to a high-risk breast-cancer clinic. Explication of the profiles of women who may or may not reattend may serve to inform the development and implementation of interventions to increase the likelihood of follow-up care.",

        "a": "AIMS: Estimating survival is challenging in the terminal phase of advanced heart failure. Patients, families, and health-care organizations would benefit from more reliable prognostic tools. The Palliative Performance Scale Version 2 (PPSv2) is a reliable and validated tool used to measure functional performance; higher scores indicate higher functionality. It has been widely used to estimate survival in patients with cancer but rarely used in patients with heart failure. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic cut-points of the PPSv2 for predicting survival among patients with heart failure receiving home hospice care. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 1114 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure from a not-for-profit hospice agency between January 2013 and May 2017. The primary outcome was survival time. A Cox proportional-hazards model and sensitivity analyses were used to examine the association between PPSv2 scores and survival time, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to quantify the diagnostic performance of PPSv2 scores by survival time. Lower PPSv2 scores on admission to hospice were associated with decreased median (interquartile range, IQR) survival time [PPSv2 10\u00a0=\u00a02 IQR: 1-5 days; PPSv2 20\u00a0=\u00a03 IQR: 2-8 days] IQR: 55-207. The discrimination of the PPSv2 at baseline for predicting death was highest at 7\u00a0days [area under the curve (AUC)\u00a0=\u00a00.802], followed by an AUC of 0.774 at 14\u00a0days, an AUC of 0.736 at 30\u00a0days, and an AUC of 0.705 at 90\u00a0days. CONCLUSIONS: The PPSv2 tool can be used by health-care providers for prognostication of hospice-enrolled patients with heart failure who are at high risk of near-term death. It has the greatest utility in patients who have the most functional impairment.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence, location, and related factors of preoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with isolated patellar fractures. METHODS: Patients with an isolated patellar fracture, admitted between January 2013 and December 2019 at our institution, were retrospectively analyzed. Upon admission, patients underwent routine Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of the bilateral lower extremities to detect DVT; those with DVT were assigned to the case group and those without DVT to the control group. Patients in both groups did not perform preoperative off-bed weight-bearing exercises. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory test results upon admission were extracted. Variables were evaluated between the two groups using univariate analyses, and independent risk factors associated with DVT were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 827 patients were included, of whom 5.8% (48/827) were found to have preoperative DVT. In DVT patients, 85.4%(41/48) were injured, 8.3%(4/48) were not injured, and 6.3%(3/48) were lower limbs. Multivariate analysis showed that male (male vs. female, odds ratio, OR\u2009=\u20092.25), delayed from injury to DUS (in each day, OR\u2009=\u20091.29), and elevated plasma D-dimer level (>\u20090.5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, OR\u2009=\u20092.47) were independent risk factors associated with DVT. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low prevalence of DVT after an isolated patellar fracture, this study underscores the importance of identifying those with a high risk of DVT, especially those with multiple identifiable factors, and encourage the early targeted use of anti-thromboembolic agents to reduce DVT occurrence.",

        "a": "UNLABELLED: We compared short-term clinical results of the mini-subvastus approach with the standard parapatellar approach for total knee arthroplasty. Can one gain adequate access through the mini-subvastus approach without exceeding operating time, incurring additional complications, and maintaining correct implant geometry? In a prospective, observer-blinded study, 120 consecutive patients having total knee arthroplasty were operated on by one surgeon using either the mini-subvastus approach without patella eversion or the standard parapatellar approach with patella eversion. Patients were matched according to age, gender, body mass index, knee flexion, deformity, and pre-existing high tibial osteotomy. The mini-subvastus approach was technically more demanding. Reduced access and visibility prolonged the tourniquet time by an average of 15 minutes and led to two intraoperative complications. Patients in the mini-subvastus group lost on average 100 mL less blood and had better pain scores on day one [visual analogue scale (VAS): mean 2.4 versus 3.89]. They reached 90 degrees knee flexion earlier (2.8 versus 4.5 days), and an active straight-leg raise earlier (3.2 versus 4.1 days). Their average flexion at 30, 60 and 90 days was slightly better (100 degrees , 110 degrees , and 112 degrees versus 94 degrees , 106 degrees , and 109 degrees ).

        "a": "Gene-expression profiling can be used to classify human tumors into molecular subtypes or risk groups, representing potential future clinical tools for treatment prediction and prognostication. However, it is less well-known how prognostic gene signatures derived in one malignancy perform in a pan-cancer context. In this study, a gene-rule-based single sample predictor (SSP) called classifier for lung adenocarcinoma molecular subtypes (CLAMS) associated with proliferation was tested in almost 15 000 samples from 32 cancer types to classify samples into better or worse prognosis. Of the 14 malignancies that presented both CLAMS classes in sufficient numbers, survival outcomes were significantly different for breast, brain, kidney and liver cancer. Patients with samples classified as better prognosis by CLAMS were generally of lower tumor grade and disease stage, and had improved prognosis according to other type-specific classifications (e.g. PAM50 for breast cancer). In all, 99.1% of non-lung cancer cases classified as better outcome by CLAMS were comprised within the range of proliferation scores of lung adenocarcinoma cases with a predicted better prognosis by CLAMS. This finding demonstrates the potential of tuning SSPs to identify specific levels of for instance tumor proliferation or other transcriptional programs through predictor training. Together, pan-cancer studies such as this may take us one step closer to understanding how gene-expression-based SSPs act, which gene-expression programs might be important in different malignancies, and how to derive tools useful for prognostication that are efficient across organs.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The proportion of women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) receiving postpartum diabetes testing is far less than desired. Even in health care systems with high testing rates, some women remain untested. We explored what helps and what hinders women to obtain recommended testing. METHODS: In this mixed methods study, we recruited 139 patients with a history of GDM in their most recent pregnancy (6 months to 4.5 years before study enrollment) from a delivery system that had instituted a quality improvement program to increase postpartum diabetes testing rates. We determined whether they had received a postpartum diabetes test according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. Using survey data, we ran logistic regression models to assess correlates of testing status, and we conducted in-depth interviews with 22 women to provide greater context to their survey responses. RESULTS: Of the 139 women, 21 women (15%) did not complete recommended diabetes testing. From the survey data, women who visited a primary care provider had 72% (95% CI, 0.09-0.83) lesser odds of not having been tested. From the qualitative interviews, difficulty fitting testing around work and caregiver demands were the most common reasons for not testing. Untested women interpreted providers' reassurances that diabetes would resolve after delivery and lack of reminders to reschedule missed appointments and to complete diabetes testing as indicators that their physicians were not concerned about their diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among hard-to-reach women, multiple demands on their time were common explanations for not receiving a postpartum diabetes test. Consistent messages regarding long-term diabetes risk during pregnancy, access to postpartum primary care and convenient lab appointments, and systematic reminders to providers and patients are approaches that, in combination, may influence more resistant women to test.",

        "a": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To perform a meta-analysis of the effect of wakefulness-promoting agents (modafinil and armodafinil) in patients with residual sleepiness after CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE (1966 to September 2014), EMBASE (1980 to September 2014) and Cochrane Database for randomized placebo controlled trials on modafinil or armodafinil in patients who met established criteria for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, adequate continuous positive airway pressure use, and who complained of residual sleepiness. Risk of bias was assessed. Primary outcomes were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and mean sleep latencies on the maintenance of wakefulness test. Secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impression of Change, change in daily continuous positive airway pressure use, and the frequency of headaches. RESULTS: Out of 118 abstracts screened and 12 full text articles reviewed, we included 6 studies (total of 1,479 participants) in our final meta-analysis: Three evaluated modafinil, and three armodafinil. Risk of bias was unclear in one or more key domains for four studies. When compared with placebo, wakefulness promoting agents decreased Epworth Sleepiness Scale by 2.51 points (95% CI, 2.00-3.02), increased sleep latency in maintenance of wakefulness test by 2.73 minutes (95% CI, 2.12-3.34), increased the reporting of minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change by 26% (RR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.36-1.86), and increased the risk of headaches by 8% (RR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.48-2.63). Also, there was a trend for decreased continuous positive airway pressure after treatment with these agents. CONCLUSION: Wakefulness promoting agents improve objective and subjective measures of sleepiness, wakefulness, perception of disease severity in patients with residual sleepiness after CPAP therapy for OSA, and are generally well tolerated.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Dentists and other members of the dental team could raise awareness by talking about oral cancer during routine dental check-ups. A communication guide has been developed to facilitate this. However, it has been suggested that discussions about oral cancer may raise patients' anxiety and this has been documented by dentists as a barrier to having these conversations. The current research aimed to investigate implementation of the communication guide and its impact on the dental patient. METHODS: A consecutive-case sample of adult dental patients attending primary dental care for a routine NHS check-up at one dental practice were invited to take part in the study via letter prior to their appointment. Consultations of participating patients (n\u00a0=\u00a077) were audio-recorded. Before and after their appointment, patients were asked to rate their current anxiety via the six-item version of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Audio recordings of each consultation were reviewed by two raters to determine the extent to which the dentist covered the topics recommended in the communication guide. RESULTS: The dentist informed all patients that they were being checked for oral cancer, spoke about signs and symptoms, and discussed risk factors. However, they rarely recommended where help should be sought or addressed barriers to seeking help. Discussions took an average of 95\u2009s. The extent to which oral cancer was discussed did not correlate with patients' post-appointment anxiety. Patients made positive or neutral responses to the discussions. The few questions that were asked were easily addressed. CONCLUSIONS: As findings are based on one dentist working at one practice, generalization of these results should be cautious. The study indicated that using an evidence-based guide to talk about oral cancer did not appear to raise patients' anxiety in this practice population. This could help to increase awareness of oral cancer in the endeavour to facilitate early cancer diagnosis.",

We designed the CERTAINTY study (CinE caRdiac magneTic resonAnce to predIct veNTricular arrhYthmia) with deep learning for VA risk prediction from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Using a training cohort of primary prevention ICD recipients (n\u2009=\u2009350, 97 women, median age 59\u00a0years, 178 ischemic cardiomyopathy) who underwent CMR immediately prior to ICD implantation, we developed two neural networks: Cine Fingerprint Extractor and Risk Predictor. The former extracts cardiac structure and function features from cine CMR in a form of cine fingerprint in a fully unsupervised fashion, and the latter takes in the cine fingerprint and outputs disease outcomes as a cine risk score. Patients with VA (n\u2009=\u200996) had a significantly higher cine risk score than those without VA. Multivariate analysis showed that the cine risk score was significantly associated with VA after adjusting for clinical characteristics, cardiac structure and function including CMR-derived scar extent. These findings indicate that non-contrast, cine CMR inherently contains features to improve VA risk prediction in primary prevention ICD candidates.

A prototype point-of-care (POC) instrument based on monochromatic x-ray fluorescence (M-XRF) was assembled and evaluated for the determination of Cu, Zn, and Se in whole blood, plasma, and urine. The prototype instrument was validated using certified reference materials for Cu and Zn in serum/plasma, and the reported bias and relative imprecision were <10%. The M-XRF prototype performance was further assessed using human specimens collected from AD and PD subjects, and was found to be satisfactory (<20% bias) for monitoring Cu and Zn levels in plasma and whole blood. However, the prototype M-XRF sensitivity was not sufficient for quantifying Cu, Zn, or Se in urine. Nonetheless, while validating the prototype instrument, body fluids (whole blood, plasma, and urine) were collected from 19 AD patients, 23 PD patients, and 24 controls specifically for trace element analysis using well-validated methods based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This limited biomonitoring study provided robust data for up to 16 elements including Sb, As, Ba, Cd, Cs, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mo, Se, Tl, Sn, Zn, and U in plasma, whole blood, and urine. The results did not indicate any significant differences in most trace elements studied between AD or PD patients compared to controls, although the sample size is limited. A statistically significant increase in plasma Se was identified for PD patients relative to AD patients, but this could be due to age differences.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary hypertensive patients were retrospectively enrolled from outpatient clinics. The demographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were collected. All participants were followed for 1 year. Cardiovascular outcomes included composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Adverse event was defined as falling down and GFR decrease at follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1226 patients were included. Based on therapeutic BP goals, participants were divided into low (< 130/80 mm Hg) and high (< 140/90 mm Hg) therapeutic goal groups and an uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265 140/90 mm Hg) group. Compared to the low therapeutic goal group, patients in the uncontrolled group were older and more likely to be smokers, have longer duration of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lower GFR and higher prevalent ischemic stroke (p < 0.05). Patients in the uncontrolled hypertension group had higher incidence of composite endpoints than low and high therapeutic goal groups. Two cases of falling down were observed in the low therapeutic goal group and no significant changes in GFR were observed. With adjustment for confounding factors, the uncontrolled hypertension group had higher risk of composite endpoints compared to low and high therapeutic goal groups, and these benefits were more prominent in the low versus high therapeutic goal group. CONCLUSIONS: In hypertension patients, when compared to uncontrolled hypertension patients, low therapeutic BP goal is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes than high therapeutic BP goal.",

        "a": "The aim of our study was to evaluate bone metabolism with measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) after management (chemo-, radiotherapy) for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone mineral density (g/cm2) of lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Norland bone densitometer) in 18 children with ALL and a median of 34 months' post-diagnosis with no history of relapse, secondary malignancy, or transplantation. In addition, patients' BMDs were correlated with particular attention to age, sex and time (years) from completion of chemotherapy. The results were compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls of the same population and expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Mean age of children was 9.8 +/- 3.7 years. Of 18 children (10 boys and 8 girls), 13 were grouped as standard and 5 as high-risk, respectively. Based on z-score values, 9 were classified as normal (z-score <1 SD), 7 as osteopenic (z-score 1-2.5 SD) and 2 as osteoporotic (z-score >2.5 SD). Children with ALL had reduced lumbar BMDs (z score -0.99) in comparison to healthy controls (z score -0.14) (p=0.011), which is indicative of relative osteopenia. Moreover, the reduced BMD was associated with patient age (z score -0.14 and -1.52 for ages <10 and >10 years, respectively, p=0.016). Reduced BMD was not correlated with time from completion of chemotherapy (p=0.33), risk group (p=0.9) and sex (p=0.3). We conclude that children's BMDs are reduced after completion of chemotherapy for ALL. The causes are multifactorial and mainly related to antineoplastic treatments, such as corticosteroids and methotrexate, physical inactivity and cranial irradiation. We suggest that further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effect on BMD in these children and to prevent pathological fractures later in life.",

Participants completed a structured questionnaire and a validated measure of depressive symptoms. Multivariable linear mixed models were used to identify work-related risk factors for depressive symptoms scores. An estimated 38% of nurses had depressive symptoms. More than 10% of the nurses often experienced workplace violence, and 64.22% encountered it occasionally. Depressive symptoms were associated with frequent workplace violence, long working hours (more than 45 hours per week), frequent night shifts (two or more per week), and specific departments. These findings indicate that interventions to minimize workload and improve nurse-patient relationships are essential to combat depressive symptoms among nurses.

        "a": "Babesia microti is a malaria-like parasite, which infects \u223c2000 people annually, such that babesiosis is now a notifiable disease in the United States. Immunocompetent individuals often remain asymptomatic and are tested only after they feel ill. Susceptible C3H/HeJ mice show several human-like disease manifestations and are ideal to study pathogenesis of Babesia species. In this study, we examined parasitemia of B. microti at different time points and assessed its impact on hemoglobin levels in blood, on spleen pathology and overall immune response in C3H/HeJ mice. Peak parasitemia of 42.5% was immediately followed by diminished hemoglobin level. Parasitemia at 21 days of infection was barely detectable by microscopy presented 5.7 \u00d7 108 to 5.9 \u00d7 109B. microti DNA copies confirming the sensitivity of our qPCR. We hypothesize that qPCR detects DNA released from recently lysed parasites or from extracellular B. microti in blood, which are not easily detected in blood smears and might result in under-diagnosis of babesiosis in patients. Splenectomized patients have been reported to show increased babesiosis severity and result in high morbidity and mortality. These results emphasize the importance of splenic immunity in resolution of B. microti infection. Splenomegaly in infected mice associated with destruction of marginal zone with lysed erythrocytes and released B. microti life forms in our experiments support this premise. At conclusion of the experiment at 21 days post-infection, significant splenic B and T cells depletion and increase in macrophages levels were observed in B. microti infected mice suggesting a role of macrophage in disease resolution. Infected mice also showed significantly higher plasmatic concentration of CD4 Th1 cells secreted cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 while cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secreted by Th2 cells increase was not always significant. Thus, Th1 cells-mediated immunity appears to be important in clearance of this intracellular pathogen. Significant increase in IL-6 that promotes differentiation of Th17 cells was observed but it resulted in only moderate change in IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22, all secreted by Th17 cells. A similar immune response to Trypanosoma infection has been reported to influence the clearance of this protozoan, and co-infecting pathogen(s).",

PROCEDURE: Study subjects (age \u2265 18 years and \u226510 years post-diagnosis) participated in an institutional follow-up protocol and risk-based clinical evaluation based on Children's Oncology Group guidelines. Trabecular volumetric BMD was ascertained using quantitative computed tomography, reported as age- and sex-specific Z-scores. RESULTS: At median age 31 years, 5.7% of 845 subjects had a BMD Z-score of \u2264-2 and 23.8% had a Z-score of -1 to -2. Cranial radiation dose of \u226524 Gy, but not cumulative methotrexate or prednisone equivalence doses, was associated with a twofold elevated risk of a BMD Z-score of \u2264-1. The cranial radiation effect was stronger in females than in males. In a subset of 400 subjects, 67% of those who previously had a BMD Z-score of \u2264-2 improved by one or more categories a median of 8.5 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Very low BMD was relatively uncommon in this sample of adult survivors of childhood ALL, and BMD Z-scores tended to improve from adolescence to young adulthood. High-dose cranial or craniospinal radiation exposure was the primary predictor of suboptimal BMD in our study. Given that cranial radiation treatment for childhood ALL is used far more sparingly now than in earlier treatment eras, concerns about persistently low BMD among most current childhood ALL patients may be unwarranted.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with high-risk, operable breast cancer were treated with three cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, followed by twice-weekly paclitaxel 30 mg/m2 and concurrent radiation. Core biopsies were obtained at baseline and 24 to 72 hours after the first cycle of paclitaxel. After completing neoadjuvant treatment, patients underwent definitive surgery. The primary end point was pathologic complete response, which is defined as the absence of any invasive cancer at surgery. Potential markers of therapeutic response were evaluated including markers of proliferation, apoptosis, p21, HER2, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor status. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients enrolled, 13 (34%) had a pathologic complete response. There was no significant difference in baseline Ki-67 between responders (35%) and nonresponders (28%; P = 0.45). There was also no significant change in Ki-67 following paclitaxel administration. Despite this lack of immunohistologic change in proliferative activity, baseline mitotic index was higher for patients with pathologic complete response over nonresponders (27 versus 10, P = 0.003). Moreover, the increase in mitotic index following paclitaxel administration was associated with pathologic complete response. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant paclitaxel/radiation is effective and well tolerated. Tumor proliferation at baseline and response to chemotherapy as measured by mitotic activity may serve as an important indicator of pathologic response to neoadjuvant paclitaxel/radiation.",

        "a": "Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been proposed as the treatment of choice for young high-risk patients who suffered cryptogenic stroke and/or peripheral paradoxical embolism. We sought to compare prospectively two different devices used for percutaneous PFO closure.Prospective data were collected on 40 high risk patients (females: 38%, mean age : 44 +/- 11 years, interatrial septal aneurysm >10 mm: 68%) who underwent percutaneous PFO closure after cryptogenic stroke (n = 38) or peripheral paradoxical embolism (n = 2). Chronologically, 20 patients were first treated by a PFO-Star (Cardia, Burnsville, MI) device. Then, 20 other patients received a Starflex occluder (NMT, Boston, MA). The primary endpoint was complete PFO closure at 6 months as assessed by transthoracic contrast echocardiography. Secondary endpoints were major peri- or post procedural complications and clinical recurrence at 1 year follow-up.Baseline clinical and anatomical characteristics were comparable for both groups. Complete PFO closure was observed in 50% (PFO-Star) and 90% (Starflex) of patients (p=0.001) respectively. Major peri-procedural complications occurred in the PFO-star group only: right-sided device thrombus (1 patient) and aorto-right atrial fistula (1 patient). At 1 year follow-up, no clinical recurrence occurred.In conclusion, despite the absence of clinical recurrence in this high-risk population with presumed paradoxical embolism, complete PFO closure at 6 months follow-up was significantly related to the type of closure device used.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Advanced age has been a criterion for denying admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to the perceived poorer outcome and increased resource utilisation. We studied the relationship between age and outcome of the critically ill mechanically-ventilated patients admitted to the MICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included patients admitted to the MICU for mechanical ventilation between 1994 and 1998. These were divided into 2 cohorts, with 206 patients aged 65 and above and 159 below 65 years. Outcome measures were MICU and hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) in the MICU and hospital. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association between age and MICU and hospital mortality, as well as MICU and hospital LOS. Factors adjusted for included gender, smoking history, pre-hospitalisation functional status, ambulatory status, use of inotropes and APACHE II (m) scores (APACHE II scores were modified to exclude age points). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed no statistically significant relationship between age and MICU or hospital mortality and LOS. However, APACHE IIM scores were significantly related to both MICU and hospital mortality (OR, 1.1; CI, 1.07-1.14 and OR, 1.1; CI, 1.09-1.18 respectively), but did not predict MICU or hospital LOS. CONCLUSION: Severity of acute illness and chronic co-morbidities, but not age, are predictors of MICU and hospital mortality in elderly ventilated patients.",

Radiomics is not only images but also data; we think that a probability exists in a set of radiomics signatures extracted from CT scan images of one cancer tumor in one specific organ also be utilized for overall survival prediction in different types of cancers in different organs. The retrospective study enrolled four data sets of cancer patients in three different organs (420, 157, 137, and 191 patients for lung 1 training, lung 2 testing, and two external validation set: kidney and head and neck, respectively). In the training set, radiomics features were obtained from CT scan images, and essential features were chosen by LASSO algorithm. Univariable and multivariable analyses were then conducted to find a radiomics signature via Cox proportional hazard regression. The Kaplan-Meier curve was performed based on the risk score. The integrated time-dependent area under the ROC curve (iAUC) was calculated for each predictive model. In the training set, Kaplan-Meier curve classified patients as high or low-risk groups (p-value\u2009<\u20090.001; log-rank test). The risk score of radiomics signature was locked and independently evaluated in the testing set, and two external validation sets showed significant differences (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05; log-rank test). A combined model (radiomics\u2009+\u2009clinical) showed improved iAUC in lung 1, lung 2, head and neck, and kidney data set are 0.621 (95% CI 0.588, 0.654), 0.736 (95% CI 0.654, 0.819), 0.732 (95% CI 0.655, 0.809), and 0.834 (95% CI 0.722, 0.946), respectively.

The cohort was composed of 660 patients who had 2286 implants placed. Due to the high success rates of implants, the five-year survival point and standard error estimates varied little among the three models. Patients at high risk for implant failure (smokers) manifested greater variation in the standard error estimates among the three models, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 5.6%, respectively. To obtain statistically valid survival confidence intervals when performing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, we recommend adjusting for dependence when there are multiple observations within the same subject.",

Overall actuarial freedom from biochemical progression at 16 years was 82% (89% intermediate, 74% high-risk) with failure predictors: Gleason score (P = .01) and PSA (P = .03). Hormonal therapy did not affect failure rates (P = .14). Conclusion. This study helps to strengthen the rationale for brachytherapy-based regimens as being both durable and desirable treatment options for such patients.

We collected demographic and clinical information and medical burden scores. Kaplan-Meier mortality curves were compared using log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis and hazard ratio (HR). Mortality was compared to expected mortality from Minnesota population. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients with CBS had a mean age of 79.5 (standard deviation \u00b1 13.0) and were predominantly Caucasian (97%) and female (73%). In all, 20 (26%) subsequently developed a dementia syndrome, most often Lewy body. A total of 46 (60%) deaths occurred with an average follow-up time of 33.0 months. Characteristics associated with mortality included older age (75-84 [HR 3.34, P = .029], >85 [HR 4.58, P = .007]) and renal disease (HR 3.39 with 95% confidence interval 1.31-8.80, P = .012). Medical burden scores were not associated with overall mortality. Mortality was high compared to Minnesota population (P < .0001).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common hospital acquired pneumonia in ventilated patients. VAP is associated with increased morbidity, mortality duration of hospitalization and cost of treatment. Critical care nurses are usually unaware of evidence based preventive guidelines for VAP, resulting in negative impact on all aspects of patient care. This study investigated the impact of a 5-hour teaching module on nurses' knowledge to practice evidence based guidelines for the prevention of VAP. METHODS: This study was conducted at a private tertiary care teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Single group pre-test design was used. Forty nurses were included in the study. The knowledge of nurses was assessed before, immediately after and 4 weeks after the intervention. The final sample (n=40) was selected on the basis of the set inclusion criteria. The demographic data sheet was used to collect relevant information about the participants. Knowledge was assessed through a self-developed validated tool, consisting of multiple choice questions. The difference in knowledge was analysed through repeated measures of analysis of variance. The mean scores at 3 time points were compared using the Tukey's multiple comparison procedure. RESULTS: Knowledge scores of participants increased significantly after the educational intervention in the first post-test; however, there was a decline in the score in post-test 2. CONCLUSION: the 5-hour teaching module significantly enhanced nurses' knowledge towards evidence based guidelines for the prevention of VAP. Further research is needed to assess the impact of training on nursing practice and to explore factors affecting attitudinal change.",

        "a": "Several cardiovascular risk factors are characterized by the coexistence of low-grade inflammation, enhanced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. It has been hypothesized that F2-isoprostanes, a product of in vivo lipid peroxidation, may transduce the effects of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities into increased cardiovascular risk. Thus, the formation of these compounds, including urinary 8-iso-Prostaglandin (PG) F2alpha, has been investigated in clinical settings putatively associated with oxidant stress. Enhanced lipid peroxidation together with increased in vivo platelet activation have been found in association with the major cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, F2-isoprostanes may transduce the effects of oxidant stress associated with complex metabolic disorders into specialized forms of cellular activation. In particular, the low-grade inflammatory state characterizing metabolic disorders such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and homozygous homocystinuria may be the primary trigger of thromboxane-dependent platelet activation mediated, at least in part, through enhanced lipid peroxidation. Moreover, oxidative stress may promote endothelial dysfunction through increased production of reactive oxygen species that inactivate nitric oxide. Accumulation and activation of leukocytes plays a key role in atherosclerosis and its complications. Interestingly, neutrophil adhesion induced by minimally modified low-density lipoproteins is mainly mediated by F2-isoprostanes. Although epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between antioxidant vitamin intake and cardiovascular disease, several clinical trials have obtained conflicting results on the effects of vitamin E supplementation on the risk of cardiovascular events. On the other hand, the use of F2-isoprostane formation as a biochemical end-point for dose-finding studies of vitamin E supplementation has helped clarifying the unique features of its pharmacodynamic effects on lipid peroxidation. This information could be extremely valuable in the selection of the appropriate patient subgroups that may benefit from antioxidant interventions.",

Objective: To assess the association between BPH and PCa using inherited single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Design setting and participants: The participants were White men from the population-based UK Biobank (UKB). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The association between BPH and PCa was tested for (1) phenotypic correlation using chi-square, (2) genetic correlation (r g) based on genome-wide SNPs using linkage disequilibrium score regression, and (3) cross-disease genetic associations based on known risk-associated SNPs (15 for BPH and 239 for PCa), individually and cumulatively using genetic risk score (GRS). Results and limitations: Among 214\u00a0717 White men in the UKB, 24\u00a0623 (11%) and 14\u00a0311 (6.7%) had a diagnosis of BPH and PCa, respectively. Diagnoses of these two diseases were significantly correlated (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a01862.80, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A significant genetic correlation was found (r g\u00a0=\u00a00.16; 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In addition, significant cross-disease genetic associations for established risk-associated SNPs were also found. Among the 250 established genome-wide association study-significant SNPs of PCa or BPH, 49 were significantly associated with the risk of the other disease at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, significantly more than expected by chance (N\u00a0=\u00a012, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; \u03c72 test). Furthermore, significant cross-disease GRS associations were also found; GRSBPH was significantly associated with PCa risk (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.26 [1.18-1.36], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and GRSPCa was significantly associated with BPH risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.03 [1.02-1.04], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Reflux recurrence after laparoscopic antireflux surgery has not been assessed in a long-term population-based study of unselected patients. Objectives: To determine the risk of reflux recurrence after laparoscopic antireflux surgery and to identify risk factors for recurrence. Design and Setting: Nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in Sweden between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, based on all Swedish health care and including 2655 patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery according to the Swedish Patient Registry. Their records were linked to the Swedish Causes of Death Registry and Prescribed Drug Registry. Exposures: Primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery due to gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults (>18 years). Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was recurrence of reflux, defined as use of antireflux medication (proton pump inhibitors or histamine2 receptor antagonists for >6 months) or secondary antireflux surgery. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess risk factors for reflux recurrence. Results: Among all 2655 patients who underwent antireflux surgery (median age, 51.0 years; interquartile range, 40.0-61.0 years; 1354 men [51.0%]) and were followed up for a median of 5.6 years, 470 patients (17.7%) had reflux recurrence; 393 (83.6%) received long-term antireflux medication and 77 (16.4%) underwent secondary antireflux surgery. Risk factors for reflux recurrence included female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.29-1.90]; 286 of 1301 women [22.0%] and 184 of 1354 men [13.6%] had recurrence of reflux), older age (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.10-1.81] for age \u226561 years compared with \u226445 years; recurrence among 156 of 715 patients and 133 of 989 patients, respectively), and comorbidity (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13-1.65] for Charlson comorbidity index score \u22651 compared with 0; recurrence among 180 of 804 patients and 290 of 1851 patients, respectively).

While the efficacy and safety of extended use of rh-endostatin with platinum-based chemotherapy during induced and maintenance therapy are still not very clear, and whether extended use of rh-endostatin can improve survival needs further investigation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with stage IIIB-IV or recurrent NSCLC who had been treated with first-line chemotherapy plus rh-endostatin between January 2008 and June 2018. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the prognostic importance of risk factors (age, gender, smoking status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, stage, pathology, previous thoracic surgery, and rh-endostatin treatment cycles). Results: A total of 105 patients, with a median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy with rh-endostatin, were eligible for analysis. The median [95% confidence interval (CI)] PFS and OS for patients with extended use of rh-endostatin (\u22654 cycles) and nonextended use were 8.2 (4.2-12.3) vs. 3.2 (1.3-5.0) months [hazard ratio (HR) =0.50, P=0.002] and 25.1 (20.5-29.7) vs. 14.0 (9.2-18.8) months (HR =0.50, P=0.003), respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 23.2% and 92.9%, respectively. Extended use of rh-endostatin (\u22654 cycles) was significantly correlated with better PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. Patients with squamous cell cancers significantly benefited from the extended use of rh-endostatin (\u22654 cycles) (n=56, P=0.001) but not adenocarcinoma (n=49, P=0.378). Hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred more frequently in the extended group compared with those in the nonextended group but without any significant differences. Conclusions: In patients with advanced NSCLC, the extended use of rh-endostatin (\u22654 cycles) could provide additional survival benefits and satisfactory toxicity profiles, especially for those with squamous cell cancer, which merits further evaluation in a prospective randomized study in the future.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute liver failure (ALF) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can occur after immunosuppressive treatment and be fatal, although it might be preventable. We aimed to characterize the causes, clinical course, and short-term outcomes of HBV-associated ALF after immune-suppressive therapy, compared with patients with HBV-associated ALF without immunosuppression (control subjects). METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter study of 156 consecutive patients diagnosed with HBV-associated ALF (22 with a solid or blood malignancy) enrolled in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry from January 1998 through April 2015. We collected data on results of serologic and hepatic biochemistry analyses, grade of hepatic encephalopathy, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and King's College criteria. We also collected data on clinical features, medical therapies, and complications in the first 7 days following study enrollment. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with transplant-free survival at 21 days in HBV-associated ALF (the primary outcome). RESULTS: Among patients with HBV-associated ALF, 28 cases (18%) occurred after immunosuppressive therapy (15 patients received systemic corticosteroids and 21 received chemotherapy); and 128 cases did not (control subjects, 82%). Significantly greater proportions of patients with HBV-associated ALF after immunosuppression were nonwhite persons, and had anemia or thrombocytopenia than controls (P < .02 for all). The serologic profile of HBV infection, severity of liver failure (based on MELD score), and complications (hepatic encephalopathy or need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or renal replacement therapy) were similar between the groups (P > .17 for all). Factors associated with 21 day transplant-free survival were increased MELD score (odds ratio \u223cOR, 0.894 (95% confidence interval 0.842-0.949 per increment), requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 0.111(0.041-0.300), and immunosuppressive therapy (OR 0.274(0.082-0.923)). CONCLUSIONS: Within a cohort study of patients with HBV-associated ALF, 18% had received immunosuppressive therapy. Significantly smaller proportions of patients with HBV-associated ALF after immunosuppression survive beyond 21 days than patients with HBV-associated ALF who did not receive immunosuppression. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection and given appropriate antiviral therapies to reduce preventable mortality.",

The present study investigated whether social support, assessed before treatment, predicted HRQOL outcomes up to 12 months later in head and neck cancer survivors. METHODS: Using a prospective longitudinal design, patients (n = 364) were assessed on several clinical and psychosocial characteristics at diagnosis and then at 3- and 12-month follow-up appointments. HRQOL was assessed with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory (HNCI). RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that greater perceived support present at diagnosis significantly predicted more favorable global and head and neck cancer-specific HRQOL at 3- and 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that adequate social support at diagnosis can have a significant, positive impact on HRQOL in head and neck cancer survivors. Thus, it may be useful to evaluate support resources at diagnosis in order to identify individuals at risk for poor HRQOL outcomes.",

At 1\u2009year, the study met the primary end points of safety and anatomical efficacy/appendage closure. This final report of the PINNACLE FLX trial includes the prespecified secondary end point of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 2\u2009years, also making it the first report of 2-year outcomes with this next-generation left atrial appendage closure device. Methods and Results Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc score \u22652 (men) or \u22653 (women), with an appropriate rationale for left atrial appendage closure, were enrolled to receive the left atrial appendage closure device at 29 US centers. Adverse events were assessed by an independent clinical events committee, and imaging was assessed by independent core laboratories. Among 395 implanted patients (36% women; mean age, 74\u2009years; CHA2DS2-VASc, 4.2\u00b11.5), the secondary efficacy end point of 2-year ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was met, with an absolute rate of 3.4% (annualized rate, 1.7%) and an upper 1-sided 95% confidence bound of 5.3%, which was superior to the 8.7% performance goal. Two-year rates of adverse events were as follows: 9.3% all-cause mortality, 5.5% cardiovascular death, 3.4% all stroke, and 10.1% major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5). There were no additional systemic embolisms, device embolizations, pericardial effusions, or symptomatic device-related thrombi after 1\u2009year. Conclusions The secondary end point of 2-year stroke or systemic embolism was met at 3.4%.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a transient disorder of ventricular wall dysfunction, mostly induced by physical or emotional stress. TTC may be associated with adverse cardiac events. The association of cancer and its clinical impact in TTC patients has not been described yet. METHODS: In 114 consecutive patients presenting with TTC between January 2003 and September 2015, we studied the frequency of cancer diagnosis, and compared the clinical course and the occurrence of a clinical endpoint of cancer and non-cancer patients during a follow up of 4.2years. RESULTS: Of the 114 patients, 16 (14.0%) had a malignancy already diagnosed at TTC, and further 11 patients received the diagnosis during follow up. Cancer patients had higher frequency of atrial fibrillation and lower hemoglobin levels at admission than patients without cancer. While the occurrence of in-hospital events was comparable, the diagnosis of cancer at TTC event or during follow up was predictive for a higher rate of the composite endpoint. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, malignant diseases were strongly associated not only with overall mortality but also with worsened time of event-free survival during the long-term outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malignant diseases is high in TTC patients, and is a risk factor for worse outcome. Screening for malignancies should be recommended in all patients presenting with TTC. Further studies are needed to define the association on molecular levels.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) was recently validated as a scoring system to predict mortality in emergency surgery (ES) patients. We sought to examine the ability of ESS to predict the occurrence of 30-day postoperative complications in ES. METHODS: The 2011-2012 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was screened for all surgical operations classified as \"emergent.\" Thirty-day postoperative complications were defined as per ACS-NSQIP (e.g., surgical site infection, respiratory failure, acute renal failure). Each patient-related ESS was calculated, and the correlation between ESS and the probability of occurrence of 30-day postoperative complications was assessed by calculating the c-statistic. Univariate and multivariable models were also created to identify which ESS components independently predict complications. RESULTS: Of 37,999 cases that captured all ESS variables, 14,446 (38%) resulted in at least one 30-day complication. The observed probability of a 30-day complication gradually increased from 7% to 53% to 91% at scores of 0, 7, and 15, respectively, with a c-statistic of 0.78. For ESS >15, the complication rate plateaued at a mean of 92%. On multivariable analyses, each of the 22 ESS components independently predicted the occurrence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: ESS reliably predicts postoperative complications in ES patients. Such a score could prove useful for (1) perioperative patient and family counseling and (2) benchmarking the quality of ES care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic, level III.",

METHODS: A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted that included data from 2002 to 2013. The National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort data from 2002 to 2013 was used for the study. Of a total study population of 143,884 individuals, 28,110 individuals with anal fissures were assigned to the case group, while 115,774 individuals without anal fissures were assigned to the control group based on the 1:4 propensity score matching age, sex, and year (case: diagnosed year, control: health service received year). RESULTS: The risk of anorectal cancer was higher in the case group (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.53) compared to the control group. After grouping anorectal cancers into anal cancer and rectal cancer, the risk remained higher in the case group (anal cancer HR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.48-5.27; rectal cancer HR: 1.82, 95% CI; 1.37-2.42). The case group was further categorized into patients with fissures and patients with fistulas; patients with fissures showed a higher risk of developing anorectal cancer than patients with fistulas (HR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.53-2.73 vs. HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13-2.66). Study participants in their 30s and 40s had a 4.19- and 7.39-times higher risk of anorectal cancer compared to those in the higher age groups (0.64-1.84), while patients who did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) had a higher risk of developing anorectal cancer (HR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56-2.80).

        "a": "PURPOSE: The benefit of adding androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer is unclear; therefore, we assessed the impact of adding ADT to dose-escalated RT on freedom from failure (FFF). METHODS: Three groups of men treated with intensity modulated RT or 3-dimensional conformal RT (75.6-78 Gy) from 1993-2008 for prostate cancer were categorized as (1) 326 intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone, (2) 218 intermediate-risk patients treated with RT and \u22646 months of ADT, and (3) 274 low-risk patients treated with definitive RT. Median follow-up was 58 months. Recursive partitioning analysis based on FFF using Gleason score (GS), T stage, and pretreatment PSA concentration was applied to the intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 5-year FFF. RESULTS: Based on recursive partitioning analysis, intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone were divided into 3 prognostic groups: (1) 188 favorable patients: GS 6, \u2264T2b or GS 3+4, \u2264T1c; (2) 71 marginal patients: GS 3+4, T2a-b; and (3) 68 unfavorable patients: GS 4+3 or T2c disease. Hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence in each group were 1.0, 2.1, and 4.6, respectively. When intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone were compared to intermediate-risk patients treated with RT and ADT, the greatest benefit from ADT was seen for the unfavorable intermediate-risk patients (FFF, 74% vs 94%, respectively; P=.005). Favorable intermediate-risk patients had no significant benefit from the addition of ADT to RT (FFF, 94% vs 95%, respectively; P=.85), and FFF for favorable intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone approached that of low-risk patients treated with RT alone (98%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer did not benefit from the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT, and their FFF was nearly as good as patients with low-risk disease. In patients with GS 4+3 or T2c disease, the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT did improve FFF.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: For 199 hospitals a multidimensional hospital OBCS was calculated on the number of times that aspirin, thienopyridine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), statin, \u03b2-blocker, and referral for cardiac rehabilitation was given to individual patients, divided by the overall number of opportunities that hospitals had to give that care. OBCS and its six components were compared using funnel plots. Associations between OBCS performance and 30-day and 6-month all-cause mortality were quantified using mixed-effects regression analysis. Median hospital OBCS was 95.3% (range 75.8-100%). By OBCS, 24.1% of hospitals were below funnel plot 99.8% CI, compared to aspirin (11.1%), thienopyridine (15.1%), \u03b2-blockers (14.7%), ACEi (19.1%), statins (12.1%), and cardiac rehabilitation (17.6%) on discharge. Mortality (95% CI) decreased with increasing hospital OBCS quartile at 30 days [Q1, 2.25% (2.07-2.43%) vs. Q4, 1.40% (1.25-1.56%)] and 6 months [Q1, 7.93% (7.61-8.25%) vs. Q4, 5.53% (5.22-5.83%)]. Hospital OBCS quartile was inversely associated with adjusted 30-day and 6-month mortality [OR (95% CI), 0.87 (0.80-0.94) and 0.92 (0.88-0.96), respectively] and persisted after adjustment for coronary artery catheterization [0.89 (0.82-0.96) and 0.95 (0.91-0.98), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional hospital OBCS in AMI survivors are high, discriminate hospital performance more readily than single performance indicators, and significantly inversely predict early and longer-term mortality.",

        "a": "The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index is the most widely used estimated formula to screen for advanced hepatic fibrosis; however, it has a considerable intermediate zone. Here, we propose an algorithm to reduce the intermediate zone and improve the diagnostic performance of screening for advanced liver fibrosis by incorporating Mac-2-binding protein glycan isomer (M2BPGi) into a FIB-4 based screening strategy in an average risk group. Four-hundred eighty-eight healthy and chronic liver disease subjects were analyzed using a 1:1 propensity score matched for age and sex. Advanced liver fibrosis (\u2265F3) was defined by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE, \u22653.6 kPa). Classification tree analysis was employed to improve diagnostic performance using a combination of the FIB-4 index and M2BPGi. The median serum M2BPGi levels of healthy subjects, patients without advanced fibrosis, and those with the condition were 0.48, 0.94, and 2.93, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of M2BPGi (0.918) for advanced fibrosis was the highest compared to those of the FIB-4 index (0.887), APRI (0.873), and AST/ALT ratio (0.794). When M2BPGi was incorporated following the FIB-4 index, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 87.1%, 82.5%, 54.0%, and 96.4%, respectively. Moreover, 74.3% (133/179) of cases in the intermediate zone of the FIB-4 index avoided unnecessary referrals. Two-step pathway (FIB-4 followed by M2BPGi) could reduce unnecessary referrals and/or liver biopsies in an average-risk population.",

Methods: In this retrospective study, patients treated with the TFD alone or TFD combined with coiling between June 2018 to November 2022 were included. The patient demographics, the characteristics of the aneurysm, and the treatment outcomes between the two groups were compared. Propensity score matching was performed to match the variables with a significant difference between groups. Results: In the current study, data from 93 consecutive patients including 104 aneurysms treated with TFD were analyzed. In total, 43 patients with 49 aneurysms were treated with TFD alone, and 50 patients with 55 aneurysms were treated with TFD combined with coiling. Aneurysms in the TFD combined with the coiling group were larger (12.9 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 8.7 \u00b1 8.8 mm, P = 0.016) and more likely to be saccular (92.7% vs. 75.5%, P = 0.027) than in the TFD alone group. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of perioperative complication rate. During the follow-up period, the complete occlusion rate in the TFD combined with the coiling group was higher (80.0% vs. 43.8%, P = 0.001) than in the TFD alone group. These results were further confirmed using a propensity score matching analysis. Conclusion: TFD combined with coiling can be a safe and effective alternative option for the treatment of complex aneurysms. Given the potential risks of these therapeutic modalities, thus very careful consideration is required on an individual patient basis.",

METHODS: Patients were included in this study if they were at least 18 years of age and received high-dose Cy in combination with total body irradiation (CyTBI) or busulfan (BuCy) prior to allo-HCT between 1 January 2008 and 29 February 2012. The primary endpoint was the difference in overall toxicity between obese and non-obese patients. Secondary objectives examined differences in effectiveness between groups assessed by relapse at day +100, relapse at 1 year, death at 1 year, chimerisms at days +30, +60, and +90, and incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). RESULTS: Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria, 28 obese and 33 non-obese. Overall toxicity was greater in obese patients compared to non-obese patients (82% vs. 52%, OR 4.3 [95% CI 1.3-14.1]; p = 0.01), which was driven by a greater incidence of renal dysfunction (79% vs. 48%, OR 3.9 [95% CI 1.3-12.1]; p = 0.02). There were no differences in rates of grade 3 or 4 toxicity, hepatic dysfunction, or any measure of effectiveness between groups.

The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio, adjusted for baseline characteristics, for patients treated with the \u03c9-3 CA compared with corn oil for the top tertile of achieved EPA and DHA plasma levels 12 months after randomization. RESULTS: Of the 13\u202f078 total participants, 6539 (50%) were randomized to receive \u03c9-3 CA and 6539 (50%) randomized to corn oil. \u03c9-3 Fatty acid levels were available at both baseline and 12 months after randomization in 10\u202f382 participants (5175 \u03c9-3 CA patients [49.8%] and 5207 corn oil-treated patients [50.2%]; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [8.9] years, 3588 [34.6%] were women, 9025 [86.9%] were White, and 7285 [70.2%] had type 2 diabetes). The median plasma levels at 12 months in \u03c9-3 CA patients were 89 \u03bcg/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 46-131 \u03bcg/mL) for EPA and 91 \u03bcg/mL (IQR, 71-114 \u03bcg/mL) for DHA with top tertile levels of 151 \u03bcg/mL (IQR, 132-181 \u03bcg/mL) and 118 \u03bcg/mL (IQR, 102-143 \u03bcg/mL), respectively. Compared with corn oil, the adjusted hazard ratios for the highest tertile of achieved plasma levels were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.83-1.16; P\u2009=\u2009.81) for EPA, and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86-1.20; P\u2009=\u2009.85 for DHA. Sensitivity analyses based on changes in plasma and red blood cell levels of EPA and DHA and primary and secondary prevention subgroups showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients treated with \u03c9-3 CA, the highest achieved tertiles of EPA and DHA were associated with neither benefit nor harm in patients at high cardiovascular risk.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: The optimal technique to administer image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer remains poorly defined. This study assessed outcomes after multiparametric prostate MRI-based planning was delivered with image-guided radiation therapy using prostatic calculi observed on cone beam CT (CBCT). METHODS: Between January 2015 and December 2017, 94 consecutive patients were treated with CBCT-based image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) without fiducial markers. MRI was routinely incorporated for target delineation and intraprostatic tumor nodules were boosted to allow reduced doses to normal appearing prostate. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of prostatic calcifications while toxicity and biochemical control were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 39.7 months with 82% NCCN intermediate to very high risk. Intraprostatic calculi were noted in 68% of patients. The 3-year biochemical control, late grade \u22652 rectal toxicity and late grade \u22652 urinary toxicity rates were 96%, 3 and 7%, respectively. Biochemical control and toxicity were not significantly impacted by the presence of prostatic calculi. CONCLUSION: Prostatic calcifications can serve as natural fiducial markers to allow for non-invasive IGRT for prostate cancer with promising early disease control and toxicity outcomes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Prostate calcification-guided IGRT is technically feasible.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, SSIs constitute a financial burden and negatively impact on patient quality of life (QoL). AIM: To assess, and evaluate the evidence for, the cost and health-related QoL (HRQoL) burden of SSIs across various surgical specialties in six European countries. METHODS: Electronic databases and conference proceedings were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the cost and HRQoL burden of SSIs. Studies published post 2005 in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK were eligible for data extraction. Studies were categorized by surgical specialty, and the primary outcomes were the cost of infection, economic evaluations, and HRQoL. FINDINGS: Twenty-six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. There was a paucity of evidence in the countries of interest; however, SSIs were consistently associated with elevated costs, relative to uninfected patients. Several studies reported that SSI patients required prolonged hospitalization, reoperation, readmission, and that SSIs increased mortality rates. Only one study reported QoL evidence, the results of which demonstrated that SSIs reduced HRQoL scores (EQ-5D). Hospitalization reportedly constituted a substantial cost burden, with additional costs arising from medical staff, investigation, and treatment costs. CONCLUSION: Disparate reporting of SSIs makes direct cost comparisons difficult, but this review indicated that SSIs are extremely costly. Thus, rigorous procedures must be implemented to minimize SSIs. More economic and QoL studies are required to make accurate cost estimates and to understand the true burden of SSIs.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score strongly predicts clinical outcome, mortality, and risk of thrombolytic haemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients, and performs similarly well in patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, endovascular stroke treatment, or no acute treatment. It is not known if the THRIVE score predicts outcomes with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. AIMS: To validate the relationship between the THRIVE score and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. METHODS: The study conducted a retrospective analysis of the prospective SWIFT and STAR trials to examine the relationship between THRIVE and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire device. We examined the relationship between THRIVE and clinical outcomes (good outcome or death at 90\u2009days) among patients in SWIFT and STAR. Receiver-operator characteristics curve analysis was used to compare THRIVE score performance with other stroke prediction scores. Multivariable modeling was used to confirm the independence of the THRIVE score from procedure-specific predictors (successful recanalization or device used) and other predictors of functional outcome. RESULTS: The THRIVE score strongly predicts good outcome and death among patients treated with the Solitaire device in SWIFT and STAR (Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for trend P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001 for good outcome, P\u2009=\u20090\u00b701 for death). In receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve comparisons, totaled health risks in vascular events score is superior to Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale score-100 (P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001) and performed similarly to Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy score (HIAT) (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b798) and HIAT-2 (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b754). In multivariable models, THRIVE's prediction of good outcome is not altered after controlling for recanalization or after controlling for device used. The THRIVE score remains a strong independent predictor after controlling for the above predictors together with time to procedure, rate of symptomatic haemorrhage, and use of general anesthesia. Of note, use of general anesthesia was not an independent predictor of outcome in SWIFT\u2009+\u2009STAR after controlling for totaled health risks in vascular events and other factors. CONCLUSIONS: The THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality in patients treated with the Solitaire device in the SWIFT and STAR trials. The lack of interaction between THRIVE and procedure-specific elements such as vessel recanalization or device choice makes the THRIVE score a reasonable candidate for use as a patient selection criterion in stroke clinical trials.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SNH) is a characteristic transcranial sonography (TCS) finding in Parkinson's disease (PD). SNH, found also in about 10% of healthy adults, was related to a subclinical malfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system on positron emission tomography studies. Both, liability for developing PD and frequency of SNH were found to be increased in depressed subjects. Here, we investigated whether SNH in depression is related to motor or cognitive abnormalities resembling early PD. METHODS: Fourty-one patients with major depressive disorder and 15 with adjustment disorder with depressed mood were studied clinically and with TCS. RESULTS: Frequency of SNH was similar in both groups (39, 33%; Chi-square test, P = 0.70). Larger SN echogenic size correlated with larger right-to-left asymmetry of finger tapping (Spearman test, r = 0.37, P = 0.009) and lower verbal fluency (r = -0.35, P = 0.038). These correlations were stronger in patients at ages >/= 50 years (r = 0.52, P = 0.007; r = -0.50, P = 0.020), and, independently from age, in patients with reduced echogenicity of brainstem raphe suggested to reflect alteration of the serotonergic system (r = 0.40, P = 0.045; r = -0.51, P = 0.044). Whereas bilateral sum score of finger tapping was negatively correlated with severity of depression on the beck depression inventory (r = -0.50, P = 0.001) and the Hamilton depression rating scale (r = -0.34, P = 0.019), no correlation was found between depression severity and tapping asymmetry, or between depression severity and verbal fluency. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that TCS detects a subgroup of patients with depression characterized by symptoms of early parkinsonism who are possibly at an elevated risk of later developing definite PD.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) have been reported to reflect vascular damage. Detailed profiling of these blood endothelial markers may adumbrate the pathogenesis of stroke or enable determination of the risk for stroke. We investigated EMP profiles in patients at risk for cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: We prospectively examined 348 consecutive patients: 73 patients with acute stroke and 275 patients with vascular risk factors but no stroke events. We quantified various types of EMPs by flow cytometry using CD31, CD42b, annexin V (AV), and CD62E antibodies in the peripheral blood of patients. This method allowed fractionation of CD31(+)/CD42b(-), CD31(+)/AV(+), and CD62E(+) EMPs. Clinical and laboratory factors associated with EMPs were assessed. RESULTS: Recent ischemic episodes were found to be more strongly associated with greater CD62E(+) EMP levels than with levels of other phenotypes. Increased National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores and infarct volumes in acute stroke patients were significantly associated with greater CD62E(+) EMP levels. In the risk factor group, patients with extracranial arterial stenosis had greater CD62E(+) EMP levels, whereas those with intracranial arterial stenosis had greater CD31(+)/CD42b(-) and CD31(+)/AV(+) EMP levels. The ratio of CD62E(+) to CD31(+)/CD42b(-) or CD31(+)/AV(+) EMP level significantly discriminated extracranial and intracranial arterial stenosis. INTERPRETATION: Circulating EMP phenotypic profiles reflect distinct phenotypes of cerebrovascular disease and are markers of vascular pathology and an increased risk for ischemic stroke.",

AIMS: This study aimed to identify the predictive value of perinatal factors, etiologies, electroencephalography (EEG), and cranial ultrasonography (USG) for future epilepsy after neonatal seizures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 92 children with epilepsy who had seizures during their neonatal period were retrospectively evaluated whether the contribution of perinatal, natal, and postnatal risk factors confining clinical, laboratory, EEG, and imaging to subsequent epilepsy. Chi-square, uni, and multivariate logistic regression were applied to find out predictive factors for subsequent epilepsy. RESULTS: The rate of epilepsy was 57.6 % during 1-6 years follow-up. Birth weight, Apgar scores at first and fifth minutes, resuscitation history, abnormal neurological examination, etiology, response to the treatment, abnormal EEG, or USG findings were the most important risk factors for future epilepsy in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, asphyxia, fifth minute Apgar scores, response to the treatment, USG, and EEG were independent predictors (P < 0.05) for subsequent epilepsy in multivariate logistic regression. No relationship was found between subsequent epilepsy and mode of delivery, seizure onset time, and seizure types (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although there are recent promising and advanced techniques in neonatal intensive care units, asphyxia is still one of the most important risk factors for not only poor neurological conditions but also for future epilepsy after neonatal seizures. Apgar scores, treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor background EEG activity, and abnormal neuroimaging seem to have strong predictive values for developing subsequent epilepsy. Therefore, patients with a history of neonatal seizures should be closely followed up to decrease the risk of long-term outcomes and early detection of epilepsy.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Anastomotic leakage (AL) is one of the most devastating complications of rectal cancer surgery. Not only does AL result in reduced quality of life, extended hospitalization and impaired defecatory function, it also has a high local recurrence rate. In this study, we investigated risk factors for AL as it may help to decrease its occurrence and improve patient outcomes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective, single-institution study of rectal cancer patients who underwent elective low anterior resection between April 2002 and February 2018 at Fukushima Medical University Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of AL. Patient-, tumor-, and surgery-related variables were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one patients, average age 63.5\u00b111.5 years, were enrolled in the study. The overall AL rate was 6.8% (11/161). In the univariate analysis, modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)=2 (p=0.003), use of multiple staplers (\u22653 firings) for rectal transection (p=0.001) and intraoperative bleeding (\u2265250 g) were significantly associated with AL incidence. Multivariate analysis identified that mGPS = 2 (odds ratio [OR]: 19.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.96-125.00, p=0.002) and multiple firings (OR: 18.19, CI: 2.31-111.11, p=0.002) were independent risk factors for AL.

Samples were obtained on admission and after 2 h in 231 chest pain patients who were followed for a median time of 22 months. Troponin levels were determined by Hs-TnT, conventional TnT (Roche Diagnostics) and troponin I (Beckman Coulter) assays. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was determined by the assay from Roche Diagnostics. The combined endpoint was death, MI or heart failure. When predefined decision limits were used, Hs-TnT (14 ng/L), TnT (0.04 \u03bcg/L), and TnI (0.06 \u03bcg/L) identified 63%, 46%, and 52% of the patients with positive troponin. In those with negative TnT, Hs-TnT identified 36 patients of whom 19% had subsequent events. In those with negative TnI, Hs-TnT identified 26 patients of whom 23% had subsequent events. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, both Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP were independently associated with short-term (3 months) risk of combined endpoint and long-term risk of death or MI.

The aim of this study was to clarify the temporal relationship between hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted using Taiwan's Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients Database, which included 360\u2009000 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes during the period 1999 to 2001. Patients with the first severe hypoglycaemia after 2002 served as the study cohort. Each patient in the study cohort was matched with two control patients without severe hypoglycaemia, based on a propensity score. A joinpoint regression model was used to determine trends in all-cause mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in both cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 10 157 patients with severe hypoglycaemia and 20\u2009314 matched controls were recruited. Patients with severe hypoglycaemia had a significantly higher risk of CVD (HR, 7.28; 95% CI, 5.19-10.20) and all-cause mortality (HR, 19.92; 95% CI, 13.42-29.56) during the first month compared with those without.

All-cause mortality decreased by 16.55% and 3.24% monthly during months 0-6 and months 6-17, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events and death, especially during the first month following a hypoglycaemic episode.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: From Feb 2014 to Sep 2015, a total of 128 men presenting for assessment of CSP completed all or parts of a standardized questionnaire. Overall 60% (69/116) of the men felt that the CSP had kept them either a \"lot\" or \"some\" of the time from sexual activity and 64% (27/43) had evidence of decreased erectile performance. Those with more severe pain (analog pain scores 7-10/10) had more significant sexual dysfunction than those with less severe pain, with 54% (45/83) vs. 0% (0/33, P<0.01: Fisher's exact test) noting that the pain kept them from sexual activity \"a lot\" and 70% (23/33) vs. 40% (4/10, P<0.01) noting sexual dysfunction. Diminished libido was also common in the men [43% (55/128)] as were the symptoms of testosterone deficiency [76% (97/128)]. Conversely, sexual activity often exacerbated the pain, with 37% (47/128) finding that ejaculation aggravated their pain and another 38% (48/128) patients found sexual activity aggravated their pain. CONCLUSIONS: Men with severe CSP have significantly reduced sexual function and interest compared to men with moderate or minor levels of pain. The majority of men with CSP who were sexually active were faced with worsening pain with sex and ejaculation. Clinicians should be aware of the twin risks of sexual dysfunction occurring in men with CSP and sexual activity worsening the severity of the CSP.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF. FINDINGS: Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF. CONCLUSIONS: The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To identify meaningful migraine outcome measures among key stakeholders to inform value-based contracts for migraine medications. BACKGROUND: Value-based contracts linking medication payments to predefined performance metrics aim to promote value through aligned incentives and shared risk between manufacturers and payers. The emergence of new and expensive pharmaceuticals for migraine presents an opportunity for value-based contract development. However, uncertainty remains around which outcomes are most meaningful to all migraine stakeholders. METHODS: This study utilized a Delphi survey to incorporate views from 82 stakeholders, including patients (n\u00a0=\u00a021), providers (n\u00a0=\u00a023), payers (n\u00a0=\u00a010), employers (n\u00a0=\u00a018), and pharmaceutical company representatives (n\u00a0=\u00a010). A list of 15 migraine-related outcomes was created from a literature review and subject matter expert consultation. Stakeholders reported on the value of these outcomes through a 5-point Likert scale and selection of their top 3 most meaningful outcomes. All participants except patients and employers also used a 5-point Likert scale to rate the feasibility of collecting each outcome measure. Consensus was defined as \u226575% agreement on the importance and feasibility of an outcome (Likert scores \u22654/5 or selection of an outcome as most meaningful). RESULTS: After 2 rounds, consensus was achieved for importance of 9 outcomes on the Likert scale. \"Decrease in migraine frequency\" reached 100% agreement (82/82), followed by \"increased ability to resume normal activities\" (96%, 79/82). When asked to choose the 3 most meaningful outcomes, stakeholders selected \"decrease in migraine frequency\" (88%, 72/82) followed by \"decrease in migraine severity\" (80%, 66/82). The 2 measures rated as most feasibly collected were \"decrease in emergency department/urgent care visits\" (95%, 40/42) and \"decrease in migraine frequency\" (90%, 38/42). There were statistically significant differences between non-patient and patient stakeholders in selection of \"decrease in emergency department/urgent care visits\" [20% (12/61) vs 0% (0/21), P\u00a0=\u00a0.031]; and employer and patient stakeholders in selection of \"decrease in work days missed\" [44% (8/18) vs 5% (1/21), P\u00a0=\u00a0.006] and \"decrease in emergency department/urgent care visits\" [22% (4/18) vs 0% (0/21), P\u00a0=\u00a0.037] as most meaningful outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The measures \"decrease in migraine frequency\" followed by \"decrease in migraine severity\" were identified as top priority migraine outcome measures.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: To assess the frequency and potential predictors of prostatic central gland tissue detachment (CGD), an enucleation-like reaction that sporadically occurred in a randomized controlled trial assessing efficacy and safety of prostatic artery embolization (PAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trial data were analyzed to identify patients with CGD after PAE. Clinical parameters, MR imaging findings, technical details of PAE, and periinterventional data were compared between patients with and without CGD to identify parameters for prediction, induction, or early detection of CGD after PAE. RESULTS: CGD occurred after PAE in 3 of 48 patients (6.3%); these cases had good functional outcomes, but CGD was associated with increased risk of ejaculatory dysfunction and occurrence of complications. Frequency of preoperative transurethral bladder catheterization (100% vs 13.3%; P\u00a0= .005), central gland index (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 0.86 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.69 \u00b1 0.14; P < .001), amount of particles applied (1.93 mL \u00b1 0.12 vs 0.96 mL \u00b1 0.36; P < .001), maximum early postoperative pain score (7.33 \u00b1 2.08 vs 1.89 \u00b1 2.40; P\u00a0= .009), and blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after 48 hours (69.0 vs 18.58 mg/dL; P\u00a0= .045) and 1 week (113.50 vs 5.16 mg/dL; P\u00a0= .004) were significantly higher in cases of CGD. CONCLUSIONS: CGD is a rare reaction that might be triggered by prostatic zonal anatomy, embolization technique, and mechanical or inflammatory processes. It should be considered in patients with severe postoperative pain and high CRP levels who experience voiding dysfunction after PAE to avoid complications. Investigation of larger cohorts might further elucidate this tissue response.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: The United States and the world are currently experiencing a tremendous growth in the elderly population. Moreover, individuals surpassing the ages of 80 and 90 are also continuing to increase. As this unique division of society expands, it is critical that the medical community best understands how to assess, diagnose, and treat this population. The purpose of this study was to analyze morbidity, mortality, and overall outcome of patients aged 90 years and older after orthopedic surgical fracture repair. Such knowledge will guide patients and their families in making decisions when surgery is required among nonagenarians. METHODS: The trauma registry of our level I academic medical center was queried to identify potential study participants over the past decade. Two hundred and thirty-three surgical procedures among 227 patients were included and retrospectively assessed. Parameters of specific interest were injury type, mechanism of injury (including high energy vs low energy and height of falls), injury severity score, preoperative comorbidities, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, and postoperative mortality rate. RESULTS: Overall, 4.3% of the cohort died in the hospital following surgery. Of the patients who survived, 89.7% were discharged to a professionally supervised setting. The nonagenarian population displayed a considerable follow-up rate, as 82.8% of individuals returned for their first postoperative office visit. DISCUSSION: Historically, surgical morbidity and mortality are highly associated with this age group. However, the number of nonagenarians in the United States is increasing, as are these surgical procedures. The epidemiologic and clinical findings of our study support this trend and add further insight into the matter. CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates that orthopedic surgery is an appropriate treatment in this population with an acceptable complication rate. Furthermore, nonagenarians have the potential to demonstrate a substantial follow-up rate, but postoperative discharge to a professionally supervised setting may be necessary.",

Education alone may not address barriers to asthma management due to psychosocial stress. This study evaluated the efficacy of a home-based family intervention integrating asthma education and strategies to address stress using a community-based participatory research model. Children age 8 to 13 with poorly controlled asthma and their caregivers were recruited from an urban hospital and an asthma camp. Caregivers with elevated scores on a stress measure were enrolled. Forty-three families were randomized to the 4- to 6-session Home Based Family Intervention (HBFI) or the single session of Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU). All families received an asthma action plan and dust mite covers; children performed spirometry and demonstrated MDI/spacer technique at each home visit. The HBFI addressed family-selected goals targeting asthma management and stressors. Asthma management, morbidity, family functioning, and caregiver stress were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months after the intervention. ED visits and hospitalizations were ascertained by medical record review for a year after intervention completion. Only one child (5%) in HBFI had an asthma-related hospitalization compared to 7 patients (35%) in ETAU in the year following intervention. Participants in both groups demonstrated improved asthma management and family functioning, and reduced ED visits, symptom days, missed school days, and caregiver stress, but there were no differential treatment effects. The results suggest that a home-based intervention addressing medical and psychosocial needs may prevent hospitalizations for children with poorly controlled asthma and caregivers under stress.",

        "a": "STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center, retrospective, cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to propose a surgical classification algorithm guiding the choice of surgical approaches for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the thoracic spine based on the characteristics of each patient's specific pathology. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical decision-making in this OPLL patient population requires balancing a more definitive decompression of the thoracic spinal cord through direct decompression against a higher risk of significant complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a primary diagnosis of thoracic OPLL who received surgical decompression in a tertiary spine center between May 2009 and June 2015 were included. Surgical planning was guided by our classification algorithm according to the location and the extent of OPLL in each patient. Patient demographics, neurological function using the 11-point Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, length of procedure, estimated blood loss, the occurrence of major complications, etc., were extracted from the database of electronic medical record system. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher exact test were used when data were not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients (33 men and 82 women) were included in this study, among whom 108 had a follow-up of at least 12 months (average: 51.7\u00b122.2\u2009mo, range: 12-100\u2009mo). On the basis of our classification algorithm, 11 patients were type I, 26 were type II, 60 were type III, 11 were type IV, and the choice of surgical decompression techniques used in each patient followed that recommended by the algorithm in all cases. On average, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved from 5.0\u00b11.8 preoperatively to 8.7\u00b11.7 postoperatively, with a Hirabayashi improvement rate of 63.6%. CONCLUSION: A new surgical classification algorithm guiding the choice of approach for decompression of OPLL in the thoracic spine was validated in a series of 108 patients through an analysis of their clinical outcomes and surgical complications.

So PSA is not so specific, and we know also that between 2 and 8 ng/ml there is no big difference, and that PSA is partly related to the transition zone. PSA is related to age and to the size of the transition zone, which is BPH, so you have to exclude this, and keep in mind the reference data that Joe Oesterling published in the JAMA in 1996 which is that PSA is age dependeant. I would say that for patients who are at high risk of dying of the disease, those who have a life expectancy of 10 or 15 years, that are under 60 and have high Gleason, if you consider treatment, then you have to treat them early if you want to cure them. But let's not overtreat patients who have no risk or limited risk of dying from prostate cancer, let's be more conservative. The difficulty is to define criteria. Age, of course, is the major criteria. High Gleason, i.e., a Gleason with pattern 4 or 5, and PSA velocity is very important.",

In particular, ML has been proposed for cardiac imaging applications such as automated computation of scores, differentiation of prognostic phenotypes, quantification of heart function and segmentation of the heart. These tools have also demonstrated the capability of performing early and accurate detection of anomalies in electrocardiographic exams. ML algorithms can also contribute to cardiovascular risk assessment in different settings and perform predictions of cardiovascular events. Another interesting research avenue in this field is represented by genomic assessment of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, ML could aid in making earlier diagnosis of disease, develop patient-tailored therapies and identify predictive characteristics in different pathologic conditions, leading to precision cardiology.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Unplanned postoperative readmissions are associated with high costs, may indicate poor care quality, and present a substantial opportunity for healthcare quality improvement. Patients want to know their risk of unplanned readmission, and surgeons need to know the risk to adequately counsel their patients. The Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System tool was developed from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset and is a parsimonious model using 8 predictor variables. Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System is applicable to >3,000 operations in 9 surgical specialties, predicts 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, and is incorporated into our electronic health record. METHODS: A Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System model was developed using logistic regression. It was compared to the 28 nonlaboratory variables model from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2012 to 2017 dataset using the c-index as a measure of discrimination, the Hosmer-Lemeshow observed-to-expected plots testing calibration, and the Brier score, a combined metric of discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: Of 4,861,370 patients, 188,150 (3.98%) experienced unplanned readmission related to the index operation. The Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System model's c-index, 0.728, was 99.3% of that of the full model's, 0.733; the Hosmer-Lemeshow plots indicated good calibration; and the Brier score was 0.0372 for Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System and 0.0371 for the full model. CONCLUSION: The 8 variable Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System model detects patients at risk for postoperative unplanned, related readmission as accurately as the full model developed from all 28 nonlaboratory preoperative variables in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset. Therefore, unplanned readmission can be integrated into the existing Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System tool providing moderately accurate prediction of postoperative readmission.",

From January 2003 to January 2008, 87 pathological fractures of the humerus in 85 cancer patients were surgically treated in our institutions. Histotypes were breast (n=21), lung (n=14), prostate (n=5), bladder (n=4), kidney (n=13), thyroid (n=7), larynx (n=1), lymphoma (n=5), myeloma (n=8), colon-rectum (n=1), melanoma (n=1), testicle (n=1), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=1) and unknown tumours (n=3). Lesions of the proximal epiphysis were treated with resection and endoprosthetic replacement (n=30). The remaining 57 fractures were stabilized with antegrade unreamed intra-medullary locked nailing without (9 cases) or with resection and use of cement (48 cases). The function of the upper limb was assessed using the Musculo-Skeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) rating scale and survival rate was retrospectively analysed. The mean survival time of patients after surgery was 8.3 months. Complications of endoprosthetic replacement recorded included disease relapse (n=3), soft tissue infection (n=2) and palsy of musculocutaneous nerve (n=1) whereas, for intra-medullary locked nailing there were three cases of soft tissue infection and one case of radial nerve palsy. The mean MSTS score at follow-up was 73% for endoprosthesis and 79.2% for locked intra-medullary nailing. Endoprosthetic replacement of the proximal humerus provides a good function of the upper limb, a low risk of local relapse with a low complication rate at follow-up. Unreamed nailing provides immediate stability and pain relief, minimum morbidity and early return of function.",

METHOD: Assessments of 40 children with MMA (24 females, 16 males; mean age 6y 11mo, range 20mo-16y) included tests for non-verbal IQ and fine motor skills, and questionnaires on quality of life, behaviour, and executive functions. The Paediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) score was evaluated by a paediatric neurologist. RESULTS: Children with MMA had significantly lower non-verbal IQ scores (mean IQ 92.1, SD 19.6, p=0.015) and fine motor skills (z-score -1.84, p=0.004) than population norms. Patients with posterior cerebral artery (PCA) involvement had poorer non-verbal IQ scores than those without (79.6, SD 24.6 vs 95.2, SD 17.2, p=0.042). Higher PSOM scores were related to lower non-verbal IQ scores (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient -0.43, p=0.006), while the presence of stroke, bilaterality, disease versus syndrome, and age at diagnosis had no significant effect on non-verbal IQ. Quality of life, behaviour, and executive functions were in the typically developing range. INTERPRETATION: Children with MMA are more likely to manifest intellectual and fine motor skill impairment before surgical intervention. PCA involvement is an additional risk factor for lower non-verbal IQ.

In recent years, accumulating support for an immunomodulating effect of vitamin D on both the innate and the adaptive immune systems has been presented. Through the vitamin D receptor, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25[OH]2D, induces antimicrobial peptide secretion, decreases dendritic cell activity, and promotes Th2 and regulatory T cell development and activity. In addition, vitamin D promotes an increased ratio of anti-inflammatory cytokines to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in IBD point to a role for vitamin D in ameliorating disease outcome. Suboptimal circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are common in IBD and appear to be associated with an increased risk of flares, IBD-related hospitalisations and surgeries, an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, a deterioration in quality of life, and low bone mineral density. With only few available randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigating therapeutic effects of vitamin D related to IBD, further research is necessary to determine the true therapeutic potential of vitamin D, as well as to define its optimal range in serum to achieve and maintain quiescence of disease. This review aims to summarise the latest knowledge on the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D in IBD, and outlines the potential deleterious consequences of vitamin D deficiency in this patient cohort.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are approaching the end of life and who may not benefit from an aggressive interventional approach is important but clinically challenging. The Gold Standards Framework (GSF) prognostic guide was developed using multidimensional criteria to identify cancer patients who could benefit from end-of-life care. We assessed the utility of the GSF to predict one-year mortality in ACS patients. METHODS: ACS patients admitted between May 2012 and July 2013 at the three participating cardiac centres in Europe were enrolled. Patients were assessed during admission using the GSF, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, the age, creatinine, ejection fraction (ACEF) score and the New York Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (NY-PCI) risk score. The pre-specified primary outcome was all-cause mortality at one year; secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death, non-cardiovascular mortality, re-hospitalisation for ACS and re-hospitalisation for non-ACS causes. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty-nine ACS patients were enrolled and one-year follow-up data was available for 626 patients. Fifty-two patients (8.3%) met GSF criteria for end-of-life care. These patients were older, predominantly female, had lower body mass index (BMI), and were less likely to receive angiography (75% vs 95%, p<0.001) and angioplasty (60% vs 77%, p=0.005) compared with patients who did not meet GSF criteria. Patients meeting GSF criteria had higher one-year all-cause mortality (42.3% vs 4.5%, p<0.001), cardiovascular mortality (15.4% vs 2.8%, p<0.001) and non-cardiovascular mortality (26.9% vs 1.7%; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that meeting GSF criteria independently predicted all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: GSF is a multidimensional tool which may be used to identify ACS patients that are at high risk of death and may benefit from end-of-life care.",

To assess the effect of smoking on relapses and disability in neuromyelitis optica with aquaporin-4-antibodies (NMOSD-AQP4-Ab), Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein-antibodies associated disease (MOGAD) and relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. METHODS: in a UK cohort of 101 NMOSD-AQP4-Ab, 70 MOGAD and 159 MS, and a Korean cohort of 97 NMOSD-AQ4-Ab, time to first relapse, annualised relapse rate, onset relapse severity and recovery, time to Expanded Disability Status Score(EDSS)/secondary progressive MS (SPMS) were compared between never-smokers and ever-smokers. All clinical data were collected under the local ethics between January 2017 and January 2019. RESULTS: Smoking did not affect the risk of relapse in any of the diseases. The risk of reaching EDSS 6.0 in the UK NMOSD-AQP4-Ab cohort was higher in ever smokers but this did not achieve significance (HR 2.12, p=0.068). When combining the UK and Korea NMOSD-AQP4-Ab cohorts, poorer recovery from the onset attack was significantly more frequent in the ever-smokers versus the never smokers (55% vs 38%, p=0.04). In the MS cohort the risk of reaching EDSS 6 and SPMS was significantly higher in the ever-smokers (HR=2.67, p=0.01 and HR=3.18, p=0.001). In MOGAD similar patterns were seen without reaching significance. CONCLUSIONS: In NMOSD-AQP4-Ab smoking associates with worse disability not through an increased risk of relapses but through poor relapse recovery. As in MS, smoking cessation should be encouraged in NMOSD-AQP4-Ab.",

We investigated how certain decisions in identifying diagnoses from administrative data affect the apparent prevalence of CHADS2-associated diagnoses and distribution of scores. Two sets of ICD-9 codes (more restrictive/ more inclusive) were defined for each CHADS2-associated diagnosis. For stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), the more restrictive set was applied to only inpatient data. We varied the number of years (1-3) in searching for relevant codes, and, except for stroke/TIA, the number of instances (1 vs. 2) that diagnoses were required to appear. The impact of choices on apparent disease prevalence varied by type of choice and condition, but was often substantial. Choices resulting in substantial changes in prevalence also tended to be associated with more substantial effects on the distribution of CHADS2 scores.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Use of a total risk score (TRS) based on vascular and sociodemographic risk factors has been recommended to identify patients at risk of cognitive impairment. Moreover, combining screening tests has been reported to improve positive predictive values (PPV) for case finding of cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the utility of the conjunctive combination of the informant-based AD8 and the performance-based National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) 5-minute protocol for the detection of cognitive impairment, defined by a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score \u22650.5, in patients at risk of cognitive impairment (TRS \u22653). METHODS: Participants were recruited from 2 primary healthcare centers in Singapore and received the AD8, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, CDR, and a formal neuropsychological test battery. The scores for NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol were extracted from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment items. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve analyses were conducted to determine the discriminant indices of the screening instruments, the conjunctive combination (ie, screened positive on both tests), and the compensatory combination (ie, screened positive in either of or both tests). RESULTS: A total of 309 participants were recruited of whom 78.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a0243) had CDR\u00a0=\u00a00 and 21.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a066) had CDR \u22650.5. The conjunctive combination of AD8 and NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol achieved excellent PPV and acceptable sensitivity (PPV 91.7%, sensitivity 73.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The conjunctive combination of the AD8 and NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol is brief and accurate, and hence, suitable for case finding of cognitive impairment (CDR \u22650.5) in patients screened positive on the TRS in primary healthcare centers.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) proposed a clinical classification for Stroke patients. This classification has proved helpful to predict the risk of neurological complications. However, the OCSP was initially based on findings on the neurological assesment, which can pose difficulties for classifying patients. We aimed to describe the development and the validation step of a computer-based algorithm based on the OCSP classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A flow-chart was created which was reviewed by five board-certified vascular neurologists from which a computer-based algorithm (COMPACT) was developed. Neurology residents from 12 centers were invited to participate in a randomized trial to assess the effect of using COMPACT. They answered a 20-item questionnaire for classifying the vignettes according to the OCSP classification. Each correct answer has been attributed to 1-point for calculating the final score. RESULTS: Six-two participants agreed to participate and answered the questionnaire. Thirty-two were randomly allocated to use our algorithm, and thirty were allocated to adopt a list of symptoms alone. The group who adopted our algorithm had a median score of correct answers of 16.5[14.5, 17]/20 versus 15[13, 16]/20 points, p\u2009=\u20090.014. The use of our algorithm was associated with the overall rate of correct scores (p\u2009=\u20090.03). DISCUSSION: Our algorithm seemed a useful tool for any postgraduate year Neurology resident. A computer-based algorithm may save time and improve the accuracy to classify these patients. CONCLUSION: An easy-to-use computer-based algorithm improved the accuracy of the OCSP classification, with the possible benefit of further improvement of the prediction of neurological complications and prognostication.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: In a context of increasing concern for complex care needs in medical patients, this study is intended to document the utility in pneumology patients of INTERMED, a reliable and valid instrument to assess case complexity at the time of hospital admission. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen consecutive patients were assessed at hospital admission with INTERMED by a trained nurse. At discharge, independent research workers, blind to the previous results, reviewed the medical database and a subsample (n = 144) was assessed for psychopathological outcome. Severity of the pulmonary disease was assessed with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), and psychopathology with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (cognitive disturbances), and CAGE Scale (alcohol abuse). Operational definitions were used for measures of care complexity. RESULTS: Most patients were in geriatric age, and 78 patients (24.7%) were classified as \"complex\" by means of INTERMED (IM+). In support of the working hypotheses, IM+ patients scored significantly higher in measures of care complexity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, \"number of consultations during admission\" and \"diagnostic count\") and on both anxiety and depression. INTERMED was also associated with length of hospital stay (LOS) and with both anxiety and depression after controlling for significant predictors and socio-demographic data. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about the ability of INTERMED to predict complexity of care in pneumology patients, and the first to predict a negative psychopathological outcome in any type of medical patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Benign colon polyps are increasingly being detected because of improved colonoscopic screening and early detection of masses on the adenoma-to-carcinoma pathway. Full-thickness laparoendoscopic excision is a colon-preserving technique for endoscopically unresectable polyps consisting of endoscopically guided nonanatomic wedge colectomy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and success of full-thickness laparoendoscopic excision compared to segmental colectomy for complex polyps not amenable to endoscopic resection. DESIGN: This is a retrospective case-control study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. PATIENTS: A prospectively maintained institutional database identified 22 patients with benign complex polyps managed with full-thickness laparoendoscopic excision from 2015 to 2020. These patients were compared with 22 propensity score-matched controls from the same database that underwent laparoscopic segmental colectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Secondary outcomes included operative details and postoperative morbidities. RESULTS: Full-thickness laparoendoscopic excision was successful in all patients. Patients had a median age of 64 years (41-85), and 82% were men. Final pathology revealed complete excision of benign lesions in 20 of 22 patients and adenocarcinoma in 2 of 22. For the adenocarcinomas, 1 patient underwent subsequent elective colectomy without complications, and 1 patient declined surgery. Propensity score matching was successful for age, sex, BMI, ASA score, colon location, and prior abdominal surgery. Compared with controls, cases had significantly shorter operative time (89.5 minutes (46-290) vs 122 minutes (85-200), p = 0.009), length of stay (1 day (0-17) vs 3 days (1-8), p < 0.001), and reduced blood loss (5\u2009mL (2-15) vs 25\u2009mL (10-150), p < 0.001). Thirty-day morbidity (9.1% vs 27.3%, p = 0.240) was not significantly different. An unplanned 30-day reoperation was performed in 1 patient for suspected small-bowel obstruction. There was 1 mortality due to decompensated cirrhosis in the treatment group. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its single-institution retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Full-thickness laparoendoscopic excision is safe and successful compared with corresponding segmental colectomy for complex polyps. Favorable postoperative outcomes, including decreased operative time, length of stay, and blood loss, make it a useful approach for managing complex polyps throughout the colon.",

This study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of RH and MWA for solitary and small HCC with early or late recurrence. METHOD: This retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent RH or MWA for solitary and small (\u22643\u00a0cm) recurrent HCC at Tongji hospital between April 2006 and December 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) was further employed to analyze the prognosis of different treatment methods. RESULTS: A total of 256 patients were analyzed, of whom 94 and 162 underwent RH and MWA, respectively. The overall treatment-related complication rate was higher in the RH group. Both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of RH were significantly better than those of MWA. Multivariate analysis showed that MWA, early recurrence (within 24 months after initial resection), cirrhosis, and AFP >400\u00a0ng/ml were independent risk factors for poor prognoses of recurrent HCC. The stratified analysis demonstrated that MWA and RH had similar long-term outcomes in patients with early recurrence. Nevertheless, MWA had worse RFS and OS than RH in patients with late recurrence. The same results were obtained in the PSM analysis. CONCLUSION: The long-term outcomes of HCC patients with late recurrence were significantly better than those with early recurrence. RH should be the first choice for solitary small recurrent HCC patients with late recurrence, while MWA should be selected for those with early recurrence.",

However, the diverse expression, prognosis and associations with immune status of pyroptosis-related genes in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have yet to be analyzed. Herein, the expression profiles and corresponding clinical characteristics of HCC samples were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Then a pyroptosis-related gene signature was built by applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model from the TCGA cohort, while the GEO datasets were applied for verification. Twenty-four pyroptosis-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between HCC and normal samples. A five pyroptosis-related gene signature (GSDME, CASP8, SCAF11, NOD2, CASP6) was constructed according to LASSO Cox regression model. Patients in the low-risk group had better survival rates than those in the high-risk group. The risk score was proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). The risk score correlated with immune infiltrations and immunotherapy responses. GSEA indicated that endocytosis, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and regulation of autophagy were enriched in the high-risk group, while drug metabolism cytochrome P450 and tryptophan metabolism were enriched in the low-risk group. In conclusion, our pyroptosis-related gene signature can be used for survival prediction and may also predict the response of immunotherapy.",

A total of 240 schizophrenia patients and 240 healthy controls underwent the Japanese-language version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and were genotyped for 115 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) at the 22q11.2 region using the golden gate assay (Illumina\u00ae). Associations between z-scores of the BACS cognitive domains and SNPs and haplotypes were analyzed using linear regression in PLINK 1.07. An additional set of 149 patients with bipolar disorder were included for cognitive assessment and selected SNPs were genotyped using real-time PCR. Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed qualitatively comparable profiles of cognitive impairment across BACS subdomains, as revealed by significant correlation between the two groups in the resulting cognitive effect sizes relative to controls. rs4819522 (TBX1) and rs2238769 (UFD1L) were significantly and nominally associated, respectively, with symbol coding in patients with schizophrenia. Haplotype analyses revealed that haplotypes containing the A allele at rs4819522 and G allele at rs2238769 showed significant negative associations with symbol coding in patients with schizophrenia. There was no effect of any haplotypes on cognition in patients with bipolar disorder.

Understanding this discrepancy is of interest given the clinical impact and intervention cost. A recent meta-analysis noted an association with mortality reduction and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) before ICU telemedicine implementation of >\u00a01. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does ICU telemedicine implementation affect adjusted mortality outcomes? If so, in what context? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective pre-post analysis comparing before vs\u00a0after ICU telemedicine implementation on the outcome of risk-adjusted ICU mortality during am vs\u00a0pm admissions as well as other objective measures of ICU telemedicine involvement. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred eighty-one patient-stays and 14,584 patient-stays were available for analysis in the implementation period before vs\u00a0after ICU telemedicine implementation, respectively. The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IVa score was 46.6 vs\u00a054.8 (P\u00a0< .01) in the am group before ICU telemedicine implementation vs\u00a0the am group after ICU telemedicine implementation, respectively. The average APACHE IVa score was 47.2 vs\u00a056.3 (P\u00a0< .01) in the pm group before ICU telemedicine implementation vs\u00a0the pm group after ICU telemedicine implementation, respectively. Overall, the risk-adjusted ICU mortality was 8.7%\u00a0before ICU telemedicine implementation vs\u00a06.5%\u00a0(P\u00a0< .01) after implementation. When stratified by am and pm admission groups, no significant difference in risk-adjusted ICU mortality was seen in the am stratum. In the pm stratum, risk-adjusted mortality was 10.8%\u00a0before ICU telemedicine implementation vs\u00a07.0%\u00a0(P\u00a0< .01) after ICU telemedicine implementation. The preimplementation SMR in the am admission stratum was 0.95 vs\u00a01.30 in the pm stratum. INTERPRETATION: We found a reduction in risk-adjusted ICU mortality with implementation of ICU telemedicine driven predominantly within the pm admission group. The pm admission SMR was 1.30, which may suggest an association with SMR of > 1 before ICU telemedicine implementation and mortality reduction. Future studies should seek to confirm this finding and should explore other important ICU telemedicine outcomes in the context of observed-to-expected ratios.",

A logistic regression model was used to identify the determinant variables and develop a predictive score.There were 2170 patients, of whom 299 (13.8%) developed overall complications and 78 (3.6%) developed major complications. A multivariate analysis showed the following adverse risk factors for overall complications: age \u226565 years, body mass index (BMI)\u200a\u2265\u200a28\u200akg/m, tumor with pyloric obstruction, tumor with bleeding, and intraoperative blood loss \u226575\u200amL; age \u226565 years, a Charlson comorbidity score \u22653, tumor with bleeding and intraoperative blood loss \u226575\u200amL were identified as independent risk factors for major complications. Based on these factors, the authors developed the following predictive score: low risk (no risk factors), intermediate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (\u22652 risk factors). The overall complication rates were 8.3%, 15.6%, and 29.9% for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories, respectively (P\u200a<\u200a0.001); the major complication rates in the 3 respective groups were 1.2%, 4.7%, and 10.0% (P\u200a<\u200a0.001).This simple scoring system could accurately predict the risk of postoperative complications after LG for gastric cancer.

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The long-term effect of immunosuppressive therapy (IS) on kidney survival in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MGN) is debated. The introduction of renin angiotensin blockade, rigorous BP control, and the increasing age at presentation of patients with MGN adds further uncertainty. Given these important changes, we sought to determine whether implementation of IS has altered outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 280 incident MGN patients from three distinct 10-year periods starting from 1975. RESULTS: We found expected changes in treatment regimens but also variations in age, renal function, severity of proteinuria, and BP at presentation over this time. Outcomes did not differ over time if these significant variations in clinical characteristics were not accounted for across the eras. The effect of IS in the 57 patients treated with currently recommended regimens was assessed using propensity adjustment to address selection bias and the effect of newer, conservative therapies. A propensity score estimating the probability of receiving IS permitted the pairing of 39 treated patients with controls with similar high risk of progression of clinical features. Using this approach, IS was associated not only with remissions in proteinuria but also with substantially improved renal survival. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that patient presenting characteristics and management regimens have changed significantly over time and the natural history of MGN has been altered. A study of propensity-matched patients confirms that current recommendations for IS have improved outcomes in MGN patients at high risk of progression.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Identifying and treating patients with transient ischemic attack is an effective means of preventing stroke. However, making this diagnosis can be challenging, and over a third of patients referred to stroke prevention clinic are ultimately found to have alternate diagnoses. AIMS: We performed a systematic review to determine how neurologists diagnose transient ischemic attack. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: A systematic literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. Publications eligible for inclusion were those that included information on the demographic or clinical features neurologists use to diagnose transient ischemic attacks or transient ischemic attack-mimics. Of 1666 citations, 210 abstracts were selected for full-text screening and 80 publications were ultimately deemed eligible for inclusion. Neurologists were more likely to diagnose transient ischemic attack based on clinical features including negative symptoms or speech deficits. Patients with positive symptoms, altered level of consciousness, or the presence of nonfocal symptoms such as confusion or amnesia were more likely to be diagnosed with transient ischemic attack-mimic. Neurologists commonly include mode of onset (i.e. sudden versus gradual), recurrence of attacks, and localizability of symptoms to a distinct vascular territory in the diagnostic decision-making process. Transient ischemic attack diagnosis was more commonly associated with advanced age, preexisting hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologists rely on certain clinical and demographic features to distinguish transient ischemic attacks from mimics, which are not currently reflected in widely used risk scores. Clarifying how neurologists diagnose transient ischemic attack may help frontline clinicians to better select patients for referral to stroke prevention clinics.",

Here, we analyzed the predictive value of various PET/CT parameters in patients with DLBCL. Particularly, we were interested in patients with an IPI score of 1, 2, or 3, whose prognosis are confusing. Between Jul 2008 and Feb 2010, a total of 100 patients (including 57 patients with an IPI score of 1-3) who were treated with R-CHOP for DLBCL, and had assessable PET/CT parameters were analyzed in this study. Absolute value of SUVmax, SUVsum(sum of SUVmax) and TLGsum(SUVmean x Volumemeta) from baseline and interim PET/CT, and \u0394SUVsum, \u0394SUVmax, and \u0394TLGsum between baseline and interim PET/CT were selected as PET/CT parameters. The median number of R-CHOP cycles was 6, and interim PET/CT was performed after 2 or 3 cycles. None of the parameters which showed percentile change between initial and interim PET/CT were associated with prognosis. Instead, absolute value of SUVsum from baseline PET/CT, and SUVmax and SUVsum from interim PET/CT were significantly relevant to PFS in all patients, and in patients with an IPI score of 1\u20133.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: The feasibility and long-term outcomes of mitral valve (MV) repair in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) remain unclear. METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 1999 patients who underwent MV surgery for IE during 2000 to 2013. The patients were more likely to have undergone valve replacement (1575 patients; 78.8%) than valve repair (424 patients; 21.2%). After 1:1 propensity score matching, 352 patients in each group were included for analysis. Perioperative outcomes and late composite end points, comprising all-cause mortality, MV reoperation, any stroke, major bleeding, and readmission for heart failure, were compared. RESULTS: Patients who received MV repair had fewer perioperative complications, lower in-hospital mortality rates (6.3% vs 10.8%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.031), and lower risks of late mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.80), and composite end point (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) during a mean follow-up of 4.8\u00a0years. Subgroup analysis revealed a trend in which the beneficial effect of MV repair was not apparent when surgeries were performed in hospitals within the lowest volume quartile (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a0.091). In patients who underwent surgery during active IE, MV repair was also related to a lower rate of late mortality (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral repair for IE has better perioperative and late outcomes than mitral replacement. Mitral repair performed by an experienced team is recommended for IE patients instead of MV replacement whenever possible, even with an active infection status.",

PROCEDURES: Here we evaluated whether HLA-DPB1 and Predicted Indirectly ReCognizable HLA-Epitope (PIRCHE) matching can improve donor selection and minimize risks specific for a pediatric cohort undergoing HSCT in Berlin between 2014 and 2016. RESULTS: The percentage of HLA-DPB1-mismatched HSCT in the pediatric cohort was in line with the general distribution among matched unrelated donor HSCT. Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches were not associated with a higher incidence of GvHD, but the incidence of relapse was higher in patients undergoing HSCT from HLA-DPB1-matched transplantations. High PIRCHE-I scores were associated with a significantly higher risk for developing GvHD in patients undergoing HSCT from nine of ten matched unrelated donors. This finding persisted after including HLA-DPB1 into the PIRCHE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing PIRCHE typing in the donor selection process for HSCT in children could particularly benefit children with nonmalignant diseases and support further validation of PIRCHE-based donor selection in a larger number of children treated at different sites.",

        "a": "Introduction: Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 (RACHS-1) score is a simple model that can be easily applied and has been widely used for mortality comparison among pediatric cardiovascular services. It is based on the categorization of several surgical palliative or corrective procedures, which have similar mortality in the treatment of congenital heart disease. Objective: To analyze the in-hospital mortality in pediatric patients (<18 years) submitted to cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease based on RACHS-1 score, during a 12-year period. Methods: A retrospective date analysis was performed from January 2003 to December 2014. The survey was divided in two periods of six years long each, to check for any improvement in the results. We evaluated the numbers of procedures performed, complexity of surgery and hospital mortality. Results: Three thousand and two hundred and one surgeries were performed. Of these, 3071 were able to be classified according to the score RACHS-1. Among the patients, 51.7% were male and 47.5% were younger than one year of age. The most common RACHS-1 category was 3 (35.5%). The mortality was 1.8%, 5.5%, 14.9%, 32.5% and 68.6% for category 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively. There was a significant increase in the number of surgeries (48%) and a significant reduction in the mortality in the last period analysed (13.3% in period I and 10.4% in period II; P=0.014). Conclusion: RACHS-1 score was a useful score for mortality risk in our service, although we are aware that other factors have an impact on the total mortality.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: In this article, we present our experience on optic neuritis (ON) and provide a diagnostic/therapeutic protocol, intended to rule out other aetiologies (particularly infection), and a fact sheet for parents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study of patients with ON over a 27-year period (1990-2017). A review of the available scientific evidence was performed in order to draft the protocol and fact sheet. RESULTS: Our neuropaediatrics department has assessed 20,744 patients in the last 27 years, of whom 14 were diagnosed with ON: 8 had isolated ON, 1 had multiple sclerosis (MS), 1 had clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 3 had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and 1 had isolated ON and a history of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis one year previously. Patients' age range was 4-13 years; 50% were boys. Eight patients were aged over 10: 7 had isolated ON and 1 had MS. Nine patients had bilateral ON, and 3 had retrobulbar ON. MRI results were normal in 7 patients and showed involvement of the optic nerve only in 2 patients and optic nerve involvement + central nervous system demyelination in 5. Thirteen patients received corticosteroids. One patient had been vaccinated against meningococcus-C the previous month. Progression was favourable, except in the patient with MS. A management protocol and fact sheet are provided. CONCLUSIONS: ON usually has a favourable clinical course. In children aged older than 10 years with risk factors for MS or optic neuromyelitis (hyperintensity on brain MRI, oligoclonal bands, anti-NMO antibody positivity, ON recurrence), the initiation of immunomodulatory treatment should be agreed with the neurology department. The protocol is useful for diagnostic decision-making, follow-up, and treatment of this rare disease with potentially major repercussions. The use of protocols and fact sheets is important.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Severe burn injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Well-implemented scoring systems for patients with major burns exist in the literature. A major disadvantage of these scores is the partial non-consideration of patient-related comorbidities. Published data on this matter is limited to small study cohorts and/or single center studies. Further, the effect of comorbidities on clinical outcome of patients with severe burn injuries has not yet been examined nationwide in a large cohort in Germany. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of comorbidities on clinical outcome of these patients based on data from the national registry. METHODS: Anonymized data from a total of 3455 patients with documented burns of 1% or more Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) and over 16 years of age included in the German Burn Registry between 2017 and 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Data included burn extent, body weight, age, burn depth, inhalation injury, comorbidities, mortality, number of operations and length of hospital stay (LOS). RESULTS: In the logistic regression analysis age (OR 1.07 [1.06-1.09], p\u2009<\u20090.001), TBSA (OR 1.09 [1.08-1.11], p\u2009<\u20090.001), IHT (OR 2.15 [1.44-3.20], p\u2009<\u20090001), third degree burn (OR 2.08 [1.39-3.11], p\u2009<\u20090.001), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (OR 2.45 [1.38-4.35], p\u2009=\u20090.002) and renal insufficiency (OR 2.02 [1.13-3.59], p\u2009=\u20090.017) influenced mortality significantly. If a patient had more than one comorbidity, mortality was higher and in-hospital length of stay (LOS) longer. Renal insufficiency was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) associated with the most prolonged LOS by 11.44 days. TBSA (p\u2009<\u20090.001), Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) > 3 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and IHT (p\u2009=\u20090.001) correlated with the amount of required surgeries and significantly predicted the need for intubation. Patients with arrhythmia significantly required more surgeries (p\u2009=\u20090.041), whereas patients with COPD required significantly less surgical interventions (p\u2009=\u20090.013). CONCLUSION: Preexisting comorbidities have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of patients with severe burn injuries. Further investigation is warranted in order to supplement existing prognostic scores with new mortality-associated parameters.",

        "a": "AIM: With the June 2010 publication of EU Council Directive 2010/32/EU scrutiny is now being focused on the safety and protection of diabetes nurses. METHODS: We used a questionnaire to study the frequency and risks of Needlestick Injuries (NSI) associated with diabetic injections in European hospitals. 634 nurses participated from 13 western European countries and Russia. RESULTS: When patients with diabetes who self-inject at home are hospitalized injections are given always by the staff in 31% of cases, by the patients themselves where possible in 33%, initially by staff, then the patient takes over in 12% and both staff and patient throughout the stay in 21%. 86% of nurses said their hospitals had a written policy on the prevention of NSI but, where it was available, only 56% were familiar with it. 67% of the nurses had not attended any training on the prevention of NSI and only 13% had attended one in the last year. 7.1% of nurses report recapping needles and 5.9% report storing unprotected needles temporarily on a tray, trolley or cart. 32% of nurses report suffering a NSI while giving a diabetic injection at some point in the past. 29.5% of NSI occurred while recapping a used needle. 57% of nurses unscrew pen needles using their own fingers. In 80% cases the source patient's identity was known and the sharp item was \"contaminated\" (known previous percutaneous exposure to patient) in almost half the cases (43%). NSIs were reported to the proper authorities in only 2/3 of cases. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that frequent NSI occur in European nurses treating people with diabetes in hospital settings. These injuries are a source of possible infection despite the small size of diabetes needles. The introduction of safety-engineered medical devices has been shown to reduce the risk of injury. A new European Directive that has now come into force specifically stipulates that wherever there is risk of sharps injury, the user and all healthcare workers must be protected by adequate safety precautions, including the use of \"medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms\".",

        "a": "Importance: Failure to rescue causes significant morbidity and mortality in the surgical population. Human error is often the underlying cause of failure to rescue. Human error can be reduced by the use of cognitive aids. Objectives: To test the effectiveness of cognitive aids on adherence to best practice in the management of deteriorating postoperative surgical ward patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial in a simulation setting. Surgical teams consisted of 1 surgeon and 2 nurses from a surgical ward from 4 different hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were analyzed between February 2, 2017, and December 18, 2018. Interventions: The teams were randomized to manage 3 simulated deteriorating patient scenarios with or without the use of cognitive aids. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the study was failure to adhere to best practice, expressed as the percentage of omitted critical management steps. The secondary outcome of the study was the perceived usability of the cognitive aids. Results: Of the total participants, 93 were women and 51 were men. Twenty-five surgical teams performed 75 patient scenarios with cognitive aids, and 25 teams performed 75 patient scenarios without cognitive aids. Using the cognitive aids resulted in a reduction of omitted critical management steps from 33% to 10%, which is a 70% (P\u2009<\u2009.001) reduction. This effect remained significant (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, -0.228 to -0.061; P\u2009=\u2009.001) in a multivariate analysis. Overall usability (scale of 0-10) of the cognitive aids was scored at a median of 8.7 (interquartile range, 8-9). Conclusions and Relevance: Failure to comply with best practice management of postoperative complications is associated with worse outcomes. In this simulation study, adherence to best practice in the management of postoperative complications improves significantly by the use of cognitive aids. Cognitive aids for deteriorating surgical patients therefore have the potential to reduce failure to rescue and improve patient outcome.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Although several prognostic scores for spinal metastatic disease have been developed in the past 2 decades, the applicability and validity of these models to specific cancer types are not yet clear. Most of the data used for model formation are from small population sets and have not been updated or externally validated to assess their performance. Developing predictive models is clinically relevant as prognostic assessment is crucial to optimal decision-making, particularly the decision for or against spine surgery. In this study, the authors investigated the performance of various spinal metastatic disease risk models in predicting prognosis for spine surgery to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: Data of patients who underwent surgery for RCC metastatic to the spine at 2 tertiary centers between 2010 and 2019 were retrospectively retrieved. The authors determined the prognostic value associated with the following scoring systems: the Tomita score, original and revised Tokuhashi scores, original and modified Bauer scores, Katagiri score, the Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classic algorithm and nomogram, and the New England Spinal Metastasis Score (NESMS). Regression analysis of patient variables in association with 1-year survival after surgery was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Calibration and time-dependent discrimination analysis were tested to quantify the accuracy of each scoring system at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 86 metastatic RCC patients were included (median age 64 years [range 29-84 years]; 63 males [73.26%]). The 1-year survival rate was 72%. The 1-year survival group had a good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Scale [KPS] score 80%-100%) and an albumin level > 3.5 g/dL (p < 0.05). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis showed that poor performance status (KPS score < 70%), neurological deficit (Frankel grade A-D), and hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dL) were associated with a higher risk of death before 1 year (p < 0.05). The SORG nomogram, SORG classic, original Tokuhashi, and original Bauer demonstrated fair performance (0.7 < area under the curve < 0.8). The NESMS differentiates survival among the prognostic categories with the highest accuracy (area under the curve > 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the most cited and commonly used scoring systems have a fair performance predicting survival for patients undergoing spine surgery for metastatic RCC. The NESMS had the best performance at predicting 1-year survival after surgery.",

Liver cirrhosis is associated with higher operative morbidity and mortality; however, it is not part of preoperative risk assessments calculators. We sought to evaluate the in-hospital outcomes in TEER and surgical mitral valve repair (SMVR) in liver cirrhosis. METHODS: National Inpatient Database from 2013 to 2017 was used to obtain all patients with cirrhosis who underwent TEER or SMVR using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes. The primary outcome is to compare inpatient mortality between TEER and SMVR. Secondary outcomes were assessed including length of stay (LOS) and rate of complications including cardiogenic shock, blood transfusion and prolonged ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 875 patients with cirrhosis who underwent TEER (n = 123) or SMVR (n = 752) were identified in our analysis. Patients with TEER had significantly higher comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In-hospital mortality was lower in TEER group (8.2% vs 16%, P = .04). TEER was associated with lower rates of blood transfusion (30.3% vs 61.2%, P = .02) and reduced rates of prolonged mechanical ventilation (1.2% vs 17.2%, P = .042). In multivariate regression analysis, both blood transfusion and prolonged mechanical ventilation were significant predictors of mortality in liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: TEER was associated with lower rate of in-hospital mortality, LOS, blood transfusion and prolonged mechanical ventilation in cirrhosis patients. TEER can be considered as a viable option for cirrhosis patient with severe mitral regurgitation.",

        "a": "Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the USA, and it is very common to appear in its invasive form. Detecting its presence in the early stages can potentially aid in the mortality rate depletion since at that point large tumours are highly unlikely to have developed. Technological advances of the last decades have provided advanced tools that employ machine learning for early detection. Common techniques include tumour imaging using special equipment that in most cases is not widely accessible. In order to overcome this limitation, new techniques that employ blood-based biomarkers are being explored. In the current work machine learning algorithms are exploited for the development of a decision support system for breast cancer using easily obtainable user information, age, body mass index, glucose and resistin. The explored algorithms include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Classification, all of which are used for the classification of new patients based on a dataset that includes information from previous breast cancer incidents. The results depict that the optimal algorithm based on the current methodology and implementation is the Gradient Boosting Classification which exhibits the highest prediction scores. In order to ensure wide accessibility, a mobile application is developed. The user can easily provide the required information for the prediction to the application and obtain the results rapidly.",

        "a": "Early prediction of sepsis is essential to give the patient timely treatment since each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with an increase in mortality. Current sepsis detection systems rely on empirical Clinical Decision Rules(CDR)s, which are based on vital signs that can be collected from the bedside. The main disadvantages of CDRs include questions of generalizability and performance variance when applied to the populations different from the groups used for derivation and often take years to develop and validate. This paper proposes a deep learning model using Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Units(GRU), which uses a wide range of parameters that are associated with vitals, laboratory, and demographics of patients. The proposed model has an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.97, outperforming all the existing systems in the current literature. The model can handle the missing data, and irregular sampling intervals frequently present in medical records.Clinical relevance-The proposed model can be used to predict the onset of sepsis 6 hours ahead of time by the use of a machine learning algorithm. This proposed method outperforms the sepsis prediction machine learning models found in the current literature.",

The authors investigated whether INTERMED, an instrument for assessing case complexity and health care needs, was able to identify such complex cases, to estimate the amount of comorbidity, and to predict clinical outcome for 31 consecutive patients suffering from urinary tract symptoms. To assess clinical outcome, the authors used the American Urologic Association Symptom Score, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. On the basis of the patients' INTERMED scores, the authors distinguished between low-complexity patients (INTERMED score <21, N=25, 80.6%) and high-complexity patients (INTERMED score >or=21, N=6; 19.4%). Low-complexity patients had fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, less distress, and better clinical outcome at their 3-month follow-up than high-complexity patients. The data confirmed the ability of the instrument to detect patients at risk of complex urinary tract symptoms and to predict clinical outcome.",

        "a": "Infants\u2009<\u20093\u00a0months with minor head trauma (MHT) are a particularly vulnerable group, though few studies have focused specifically on these patients. We aimed to evaluate the application of the PECARN prediction rule, designed for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) in children\u2009<\u20092\u00a0years in infants\u2009<\u20093\u00a0months, and create a specific prediction rule for this population. We conducted a prospective multicenter observational study in 13 pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in Spain. The PECARN rule was applied to all patients. A new specific prediction rule for infants\u2009<\u20093\u00a0months of age was created. The main outcome measures were (1) ciTBI, (2) TBI evidenced on computed tomography (CT) scan, and (3) isolated skull fracture (ISF). Telephone follow-up was conducted for all patients over the 4\u00a0weeks after the initial PED visit. Of 21,981 children with MHT, 366 (1.7%) were\u2009<\u20093\u00a0months old and 195 (53.3%) underwent neuroimaging, including 37 (10.1%) with CT scan. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PECARN prediction rule for ciTBI were 100% (95% CI, 20.7-100) and 99.7% (95% CI, 98.4-100%), respectively. Of the 230 infants (62.8%) who met the PECARN low-risk criteria, none had ciTBI, 1 (0.4% overall, 95% CI, 0-2.4) had TBI on CT, and 2 (0.9% overall; 95% CI, 0.1-3.1) had an ISF. Among the 136 infants (37.2%) who did not meet the PECARN low-risk criteria, 1 (0.3% overall; 95% CI, 0-1.5) had ciTBI, 11 (8.1% overall; 95% CI, 4.1-14.0) had TBI on CT, and 18 (13.2% overall; 95% CI, 8-20.1) had an ISF. The sensitivity and NPV of the Spanish prediction rule for ciTBI were 100% (95% CI, 20.7-100) and 100% (95% CI, 98.4-100%), respectively. No infants in the registry developed complications during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The PECARN rule for infants\u2009<\u20092\u00a0years old accurately identified infants\u2009<\u20093\u00a0months old at low risk for ciTBI in our population, although the adapted Spanish rule presented here could be even more accurate. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants younger than 3 months are vulnerable to minor blunt head trauma due to their age and to difficulties in assessing the subtle symptoms and minimal physical findings detected on examination. \u2022 A low threshold for CT scan is recommended in this population. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0PECARN rule for infants < 2 years old is an adequate tool with which to identify infants < 3 months old at low risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury. \u2022 Spanish rule could identify even more low-risk infants without overlooking important outcomes but it should be validated to confirm its predictive capacity.",

Individuals subjected to dialysis therapy, half of whom are diabetic, experience a mortality of ~20% per year. Understanding factors related to mortality remains a priority. Outside of dialysis units, A1C is unquestioned as the \"gold standard\" for glycemic control. In the recent past, however, there is evidence in large cohorts of diabetic dialysis patients that A1C at both the higher and lower levels was associated with mortality. Given the unique conditions associated with the metabolic dysregulation in dialysis patients, there is a critical need to identify accurate assays to monitor glycemic control to relate to cardiovascular endpoints. In this two-part point-counterpoint narrative, Drs. Freedman and Kalantar-Zadeh take opposing views on the utility of A1C in relation to cardiovascular disease and survival and as to consideration of use of other short-term markers in glycemia. In the narrative below, Dr. Freedman suggests that glycated albumin may be the preferred glycemic marker in dialysis subjects.

Since 1952 the Confidential Enquiry of Maternal Deaths Reports (CEMD) have collected and analysed data on maternal mortality in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. This publication analyses the CEMD from 1985-2013 regarding anaesthesia- and analgesia related maternal deaths during pregnancy or peripartum. During this period, there has been a reduction in directly anaesthesia-related maternal deaths to 4.3%. Yet, an increase in anaesthesia-associated maternal deaths has been recorded. The rate of fatal complications during obstetric regional anaesthesia doubled in recent years, while the fatality risk for obstetric general anaesthesia has decreased. Many of the reported maternal deaths could presumably have been avoided. The anaesthesiologist has to be familiar with state-of-the-art, guideline-based concepts for anaesthesia during pregnancy, childbirth or post partum, especially using tools like simulation. Vital sign monitoring after obstetric anaesthesia has to be identical to other postoperative monitoring, and Modified Early Warning Scores should be used for this purpose. In regional anaesthesia, current standards for hygiene have to be adhered to and patients have to be visited after spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Interdisciplinary communication and collaboration still have to be improved; careful interdisciplinary planning of childbirth in high-risk obstetric patients is strongly advised.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Recent breast cancer treatment guidelines recommend that higher-risk premenopausal patients should receive ovarian function suppression (OFS) as part of adjuvant endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is also given, it is uncertain whether to select concurrent or sequential OFS initiation. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 1872 patients enrolled in the randomized phase III TEXT and SOFT trials who received adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and upon randomization to an OFS-containing adjuvant endocrine therapy, initiated gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonist triptorelin. Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was compared between patients who received OFS concurrently with chemotherapy in TEXT (n\u2009=\u20091242) versus sequentially post-chemotherapy in SOFT (n\u2009=\u2009630). Because timing of trial enrollment relative to adjuvant chemotherapy differed, we implemented landmark analysis re-defining BCFI beginning 1\u2009year after final dose of chemotherapy (median, 15.5 and 8.1\u2009months from enrollment to landmark in TEXT and SOFT, respectively). As a non-randomized treatment comparison, we implemented comparative-effectiveness propensity score methodology with weighted Cox modeling. RESULTS: Distributions of several clinico-pathologic characteristics differed between groups. Patients who were premenopausal post-chemotherapy in SOFT were younger on average. The median duration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 18\u2009weeks in both groups. There were 231 (12%) BC events after post-landmark median follow-up of about 5\u2009years. Concurrent use of triptorelin with chemotherapy was not associated with a significant difference in post-landmark BCFI compared with sequential triptorelin post-chemotherapy, either in the overall population (HR\u2009=\u20091.11, 95% CI 0.72-1.72; P\u2009=\u20090.72; 4-year BCFI 89% in both groups), or in the subgroup of 692 women\u2009<40\u2009years at diagnosis (HR\u2009=\u20091.13, 95% CI 0.69-1.84) who are less likely to develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. CONCLUSION: Based on comparative-effectiveness modeling of TEXT and SOFT after about 5\u2009years median follow-up, with limited statistical power especially for the subgroup\u2009<40\u2009years, neither detrimental nor beneficial effect of concurrent administration of OFS with chemotherapy on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy that includes chemotherapy was detected.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The Strategy for Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guided PTCA and Stenting (SIPS) trial included a prospectively designed subgroup analysis to investigate whether routine IVUS-guidance during percutaneous intervention improves long-term outcome in diabetics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive diabetic patients (n = 43) with 57 lesions were randomly assigned to receive provisional stenting with angiographic guidance only (ANGIO) or with IVUS guidance provided by a combined IVUS/variable diameter balloon catheter (IVUS). The combined primary endpoint included death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularisation (TVR) and was recorded for 28 months. The re-stenosis rate at 6-month follow-up angiography was defined as a secondary endpoint. A primary endpoint occurred in 6 diabetic patients (31.6%) in the IVUS-group and 11 diabetic patients (45.8%) in the ANGIO-group (relative risk for IVUS, 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.28-2.35, p = 0.83). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that IVUS did slightly attenuate the negative effect of diabetes on long-term event-free survival. The quantitative assessment of follow-up angiography revealed that the incidence of re-stenosis was high in both groups (IVUS: 53% versus ANGIO: 52%, p = 0.94). There was no difference in the mean duration of hospitalisation (11.8 days with IVUS versus 11.2 days with ANGIO, p = 0.83) or total cost (US dollars 16,725 with IVUS versus US dollars 16,230 with ANGIO, p = 0.83) during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Routine IVUS-guidance during provisional stenting seems to slightly attenuate the negative effect of diabetes on long-term outcome. However, the re-stenosis rate remains very high.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Up to 26.5% of new diagnosed prostate cancers (PCa) are locally advanced (LA). Although traditionally discouraged in this setting, radical prostatectomy (RP) lowers the risk of metastatic progression and cancer-specific death. We report a review of the available evidences and describe our surgical technique of extrafascial robot-assisted RP. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed/Medline database was searched for \"prostate cancer,\" \"high-risk,\" \"locally advanced,\" \"prostatectomy.\" Duplicates and expert opinion papers were removed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: RP is an option in selected patients with LA-PCa and >10 years life expectancy. Five, 10 and 15 years after open RP, disease free survival rates were 85%, 73% and 67%. At the same time-points, cancer specific survival and overall survival were 95%, 90%, 79% and 90%, 76%, 53%, respectively. Postoperative potency was achieved by 25% of the patients while 79% were continent. Robotic prostatectomy provides comparable cancer control outcomes, but it is associated with a lower transfusion rate and a shorter hospitalization time. The concept of \"extrafascial prostatectomy\" was introduced in 2000 by Villers: this surgical approach reduces the incidence of mid- and postero-lateral positive margins (28% vs. 51%, when compared to intrafascial; P=0.08), expecially in pT3 cancers, but markedly affects potency. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted RP is an option in patients with LA-PCa. Removing the prostate gland and the seminal vesicles still contained inside their aponeurotic covering, minimize the risk of positive surgical margins and clinical recurrence.",

        "a": "Colorectal cancer is a common and often deadly cancer. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been implicated as a potentially valuable prognosis factor. The detection of circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) and of simple blood component parameters that reflect inflammatory status, such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), may provide information about tumor progression. The aim of this study was to explore the importance of CTCs, CTM, PLR, and NLR prospectively in non-metastatic colon cancer progression. CTCs were enriched using ISET\u24c7 (Isolation by SizE of Tumor cells) and identified by immunocytochemical exclusion of leukocytes. We evaluated CTCs and blood cell parameters in a cohort of 69 stage I-III colon cancer patients (52.2% men; median age, 61 years; age range, 19-87 years) at a baseline timepoint prior to resection surgery. The median of CTC levels at baseline was 20 cells/8\u202fmL (0-94) and higher levels were associated with CTM presence (p\u202f=\u202f0.02). CTM were found in 18 (26.1%) patients. Of 18 stage I patients, 33.3% had CTM and of 51 stages II or III patients, 13.7% had CTM (p\u202f=\u202f0.08). Patients with a high PLR (>124) were mostly (75.6%) diagnosed with high-risk stages II/III cancer (stages I/low-risk II, 24.4%; p\u202f=\u202f0.014). All 8 patients that had disease recurrence during follow-up had a high PLR (p\u202f=\u202f0.02\u202fvs. low PLR). NLR was not significantly associated with disease stage or recurrence.

However, myocarditis, which is a rare, yet potentially severe adverse-related event associated with ICIs, could be under-reported. Objectives: This study is aimed to prospectively evaluate the cumulative incidence rate of myocarditis, through systematic screening, among patients receiving ICIs for lung cancer. Methods: All patients who received the first administration of ICIs for non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), between May and November 2020, in the pulmonary department of Bordeaux University Hospital, were included. Echocardiography (ECG), troponin-I, and natriuretic peptide dosages before ICIs' first administration and before each infusion were recorded. ECG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were done additionally, in case of at least three times increase in troponin levels, ECG modifications, and the onset of cardiovascular symptoms. Second, if possible, coronarography than endomyocardial biopsy was assessed. The primary outcome was defined as ICIs related to myocarditis onset, while secondary outcomes included other cardiovascular events, disease-free, and overall survival. Results: During the period of interest, 99 patients received their first infusion of ICIs for lung cancer (mean age 64 \u00b1 9 years; 52 men, 67% with adenocarcinoma). Three cases of myocarditis without major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) occurred (two definite and one possible), and the mean duration between the first ICIs' administration and myocarditis onset was 144 \u00b1 3 days. Median disease-free survival and overall survival were 169 [102; 233] days and 209 [147; 249] days, respectively. Conclusion: In our study, systematic screening of myocarditis associated with ICIs leads to a more frequent incidence and a later onset than previously reported. None of them were severe. Additional prospective evidence is needed before we could adopt routine cardiac screening in unselected patients starting ICIs; however, these data shed new light on the risk of myocarditis associated with ICIs administration.",

        "a": "AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this retrospective study was to review and discuss the outcome of surgical management and other clinical predictors influencing the prognosis of war missile penetrating brain injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine clinical predictors that influence the prognosis of war missile penetrating brain injury, 126 surgically treated patients who had sustained such an injury during the two-year period of war in Croatia (1991-1993) were retrospectively analyzed. Investigated clinical features were: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission; extent of brain injury; time between injury and hospital admission; presence of intracranially retained foreign bodies or bone fragments; development of postinjury and posttraumatic complications; and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at six-month follow up. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients survived penetrating missile brain injury, in most of them with GCS score above 8 on admission. The mean time interval to hospital admission in this group of patients was less than two hours. Twelve of 67 patients developed different complications. All patients recovered well according to GOS (GOS 5 and 4) at six-month follow up. Fifty-nine patients died. The wounded who were in moribund state on the hospital admission (n = 11), and those who died during surgery (n = 8) were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 40 patients who did not survive were analyzed. The majority of them had GCS score 3-8 on admission. They mostly sustained bilateral hemispheric lesion, and/or ventricular lesion, and developed brain edema. The mean time interval between injury and hospital admission was over two hours in this group of patients. Postoperative complication developed in 9 of 40 patients. DISCUSSION: The patients with GCS score exceeding 8 had by far more favorable outcome in comparison to those with GCS score less than 8. Considering the extent of injury, patients suffering unihemispheric brain wounds had a more favorable outcome than those with lesions of both hemispheres, and particularly those with transventricular lesions. The time between injury and hospital admission proved to be another important prognostic factor. The majority of patients admitted up to one hour of injury survived, while two thirds of those admitted between one and three hours of injury succumbed. The presence of intracranially retained foreign bodies and bone fragments, and postinjury and postoperative complications implied worse outcome in comparison with their absence. CONCLUSION: The state of consciousness on admission was the most sensitive criterion as far as the prognosis is concerned. The outcome also depended on the extent of brain damage since the wounds associated with a high mortality rate were predominantly bihemispheric. Concerning survival, the time between injury and hospital admission also appeared to be important, as well as intracranially retained foreign bodies and bone fragments, and development of complications.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis and age are associated with high sarcopenia risk. Exercise is an effective treatment for preventing muscle mass loss in older adult populations. It remains unclear whether exercise affects muscle mass in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, this meta-analysis investigated the effect of exercise on muscle mass gain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and Google Scholar were systematically searched until June 2021. METHODS: The present study was conducted according to the guidelines recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the effects of exercise on muscle mass for rheumatoid arthritis were identified. The included RCTs were subject to meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment. Subgroup and random-effects meta-regression analyses were performed to identify any heterogeneity (I2) of treatment effects across studies. RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a median PEDro score of 6/10 (range: 4/10-8/10). The weighted mean effect size for muscle mass was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.30-1.24; P\u2009=\u20090.001; I2\u2009=\u200977%). Meta-regression analyses indicated that the disease duration significantly explained variance of treatment effects across studies (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.006, R2\u2009=\u200969.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.005). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise therapy effectively increased muscle mass in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment effects may be attenuated in those who have had rheumatoid arthritis for a relatively long time.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Isoflurane has shown better control of intensive care sedation than propofol or midazolam and seems to be a useful alternative. However, its effect on survival remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare mortality after sedation with either isoflurane or propofol/midazolam. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of data in a hospital database for a cohort of consecutive patients. SETTING: Sixteen-bed interdisciplinary surgical ICU of a German university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive cohort of 369 critically ill surgical patients defined within the database of the hospital information system. All patients were continuously ventilated and sedated for more than 96\u200ah between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. After excluding 169 patients (93 >79 years old, 10 <40 years old, 46 mixed sedation, 20 lost to follow-up), 200 patients were studied, 72 after isoflurane and 128 after propofol/midazolam. INTERVENTIONS: Sedation with isoflurane using the AnaConDa system compared with intravenous sedation with propofol or midazolam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital mortality (primary) and 365-day mortality (secondary) were compared with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and a log-rank test. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) [with 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] were calculated by logistic regression analyses to determine the risk of death after isoflurane sedation. RESULTS: After sedation with isoflurane, the in-hospital mortality and 365-day mortality were significantly lower than after propofol/midazolam sedation: 40 versus 63% (P\u200a=\u200a0.005) and 50 versus 70% (P\u200a=\u200a0.013), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders (coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute renal failure, creatinine, age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), patients after isoflurane were at a lower risk of death during their hospital stay (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.68, P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and within the first 365 days (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81, P\u200a=\u200a0.010). CONCLUSION: Compared with propofol/midazolam sedation, long-term sedation with isoflurane seems to be well tolerated in this group of critically ill patients after surgery.",

        "a": "In 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy of parotid gland tumors, little effort is made to avoid the auditory system or the oral cavity. Damage may occur when the ear is located inside the treatment field. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate an intensity-modulation radiotherapy (IMRT) class solution, and to compare this technique to a 3D conformal approach with respect to hearing loss. Twenty patients with parotid gland cancer were retrospectively planned with 2 different techniques using the original planning target volume (PTV). First, a conventional technique using a wedged beam pair was applied, yielding a dose distribution conformal to the shape of the PTV. Next, an IMRT technique using a fluence map optimization with predefined constraints was designed. A dose of 66 Gy in the PTV was given at the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measures (ICRU) dose prescription point. Dose-volume histograms of the PTV and organs at risk (OARs), such as auditory system, oral cavity, and spinal cord, were compared. The dose in the OARs was lower in the IMRT plans. The mean volume of the middle ear receiving a dose higher than 50 Gy decreased from 66.5% to 33.4%. The mean dose in the oral cavity decreased from 19.4 Gy to 16.6 Gy. The auditory system can be spared if the distance between the inner ear and the PTV is 0.6 cm or larger, and if the overlap between the middle ear and the PTV is smaller than 10%. The maximum dose in the spinal cord was below 40 Gy in all treatment plans. The mean volume of the PTV receiving less than 95% of the prescribed dose increased in the IMRT plan slightly from 3.3% to 4.3 % (p = 0.01). The mean volume receiving more than 107% increased from 0.9% to 2.5% (p = 0.02). It can be concluded that the auditory system, as well as the oral cavity, can be spared with IMRT, but at the cost of a slightly larger dose inhomogeneity in the PTV. The IMRT technique can therefore, in most cases, be recommended as the treatment of choice for the irradiation of parotid tumors.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is believed to be an early sign of systemic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevated levels of circulating oxidised LDL (oxLDL) and impairment of arterial elasticity have been reported to predict future cardiovascular events. We studied whether metabolic syndrome subjects with and without erectile dysfunction differ in circulating levels of oxLDL and arterial elasticity. Furthermore, we assessed whether the presence of ED acts as a clinical marker of underlying atherosclerotic process. METHODS: Seventy men with metabolic syndrome, aged 35-60 years, completed the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire. Subject was considered to have erectile dysfunction if a sum of the questions 1-5 and 15 was \u2264 25. OxLDL was assessed by an ELISA immunoassay and arterial elasticity by a noninvasive radial artery tonometer (HDI/PulseWave\u2122CR-2000). RESULTS: Large arterial elasticity index was significantly lower among subjects with erectile dysfunction compared with those without, 15.0 \u00b1 3.2 ml/mmHg \u00d7 10 and 18.0 \u00b1 3.7 ml/mmHg \u00d7 10, respectively (p = 0.001). The presence of erectile dysfunction associated with impaired large arterial elasticity, independently of traditional CVD risk factors. Reduction in arterial elasticity was also found among those with erectile dysfunction and less than 5% risk of cardiovascular death during 10 years by the SCORE. There were no significant differences in small arterial elasticity or oxLDL levels. CONCLUSION: Erectile dysfunction truly seems to be a marker of systemic vascular disease. Aggressive primary prevention should be considered for patients with metabolic syndrome and vasculogenic ED.",

        "a": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the rate of serious arrhythmias in a cohort of monitored emergency department (ED) chest pain patients and derive a clinical decision rule that can identify which patients can safely be taken off continuous cardiac monitoring at initial physician assessment. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a prospectively collected cohort was completed in a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Consecutive patients with a primary complaint of chest pain who underwent cardiac monitoring in the ED in January to April 2000 were included. Serious arrhythmias were defined as those requiring treatment in the ED. Multivariate recursive partitioning analysis was undertaken to derive a decision rule. RESULTS: Nine hundred ninety-two consecutive chest pain patients were monitored in the ED during the study period, of whom 14% and 12% had myocardial infarction and unstable angina, respectively. There were 17 patients (1.7%) with serious arrhythmias detected in the ED. The following decision rule was derived: patients can be removed from cardiac monitoring if they are pain free at the initial physician assessment and have a normal or nonspecific ECG result. The rule had 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval 80% to 100%) for serious arrhythmias. Applying this rule would have allowed physicians to immediately remove 29% of patients from cardiac monitoring. CONCLUSION: Serious arrhythmias are uncommon in monitored ED chest pain patients. A simple clinical decision rule could be used to safely identify low-risk patients who can be removed from continuous monitoring if its performance is prospectively validated in an independent patient population.",

Low-dose erythromycin is frequently used as a prokinetic agent, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is unknown whether low-dose erythromycin affects cardiac repolarisation and puts patients at risk for torsades de pointes. METHODS: In this prospective study, we included ICU patients treated with erythromycin as prokinetic in a dose of 200\u2005mg twice a day. An ECG was performed before, 15\u2005min and 24\u2005hours after the start of erythromycin. Cardiac repolarisation was assessed by rate-corrected analysis of the QT interval (QTc) on the ECG by two independent investigators. Starting or stopping other possibly QTc prolonging drugs during the study period was an exclusion criterion. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Friedman's test were used for statistical analysis to assess prolongation of QTc. Primary outcome was defined by the prolongation of QTc after 15\u2005min and 24\u2005hours. RESULTS: 51 patients were eligible for this study. In these patients, QTc increased significantly from 430\u2005ms at baseline to 439\u2005ms (p=0.03) after 15\u2005min and 444\u2005ms (p=0.01) after 24\u2005hours. After 15\u2005min and 24\u2005hours, the upper limit of 95% CI for prolongation of QTc was well above 10\u2005ms. No QTc-related arrhythmias were seen. CONCLUSIONS: During treatment with erythromycin in a dose of 200\u2005mg twice a day. QTc prolonged mildly but significantly. Sequential ECG registration should be performed when low-dose erythromycin is prescribed, especially in the presence of other risk factor for QTc prolongation.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicities over time have not been well quantified. We examined during and immediately following radiation therapy skin toxicities over time in a randomized study of mometasone furoate vs placebo during breast radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomized. Symptoms related to skin toxicity were addressed weekly using provider-reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) and 4 patient-reported outcomes (PRO) surveys. We applied repeated measures and risk analysis methodologies. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled. By CTCAE, significant differences favoring mometasone were detected over time in all toxicities except skin striae, atrophy, and infection. Statistically significant differences between arms at baseline but not over time occurred for all Linear Analog Self-Assessment. Statistically significant differences occurred for all symptoms in the temporal profile of symptoms as measured by PRO surveys (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of longitudinal methods enhanced the ability of PRO tools to detect differences between study arms. Our results strengthened the conclusions of the original report that mometasone reduced acute skin toxicities. PRO surveys can accurately assess patients' experiences of symptom type and intensity over time and should be included in future clinical trials. For radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicity, we hypothesized that clinically significant differences over time, if any, can be found by repeated measures. We examined the acute skin toxicities in a randomized study of mometasone vs placebo during breast radiotherapy. For secondary end points, we showed that longitudinal methods enhanced the detection of differences between study arms and strengthened the conclusions from the original report. Frequent patient-reported outcome surveys over time should be included in future clinical trials.",

Little is known about this ratio in patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure. Our aim was to assess the VAC ratio in a cohort of Fontan patients using a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) method, and to examine its relation to outcomes. We retrospectively assessed VAC from CMR data on 195 Fontan patients (age 19.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\u00a0years) and 42 controls (age 15.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u00a0years). The VAC ratio was calculated as Ea/Ees (Ea\u2009=\u2009mean arterial blood pressure (MBP)/ventricular stroke volume; Ees\u2009=\u2009MBP/end-systolic volume). Compared with controls, Fontan patients had lower body surface area-adjusted median Ees (1.54 vs. 2.4, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and Ea (1.35 vs. 1.48, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and a higher median VAC ratio (0.88 vs. 0.62, p\u2009<\u20090.001). After a median follow-up of 4\u00a0years (range 1-10), 20 patients reached a composite endpoint of death or heart transplant listing. On multivariable modeling, being in the lowest tertile of the VAC ratio was independently associated with the composite endpoint (odds ratio 11.39, p\u2009=\u20090.02), and inclusion of the VAC ratio in the model improved prediction compared to traditional risk factors. In patients without ventricular dilation, the VAC ratio was the only factor predictive of the composite endpoint (p\u2009=\u20090.02). In conclusion, we found evidence for inefficient ventriculoarterial coupling in Fontan patients. The VAC ratio improved prediction of outcomes and was especially useful in patients without ventricular dilation. Further investigation into the clinical significance of ventriculoarterial coupling in this patient population is warranted.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: After breast cancer treatment, follow-up consists of physical examination and mammography for at least 5 years, to detect local and regional recurrence. The risk of recurrence may decrease after event-free time. This study aims to determine the risk of local recurrence (LR) as a first event until 5 years after diagnosis, conditional on being event-free for 1, 2, 3 and 4 years. METHODS: From the Netherlands Cancer Registry, all M0 breast cancers diagnosed between 2005 and 2008 were included. LR risk was calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall and for different subtypes. Conditional LR (assuming x event-free years) was determined by selecting event-free patients at x years, and calculating their LR risk within 5 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: Five-year follow-up was available for 34,453 patients. Overall, five-year LR as a first event occurred in 3.0%. This risk varied for different subtypes and was highest for triple negative (6.8%) and lowest for ER+PR+Her2- (2.2%) tumors. After 1, 2, 3 and 4 event-free years, the average risk of LR before 5 years after diagnosis decreased from 3.0 to 2.4, 1.6, 1.0, and 0.6%. The risk decreased in all subtypes, the effect was most pronounced in subtypes with the highest baseline risk (ER-Her2+ and triple negative breast cancer). After three event-free years, LR risk in the next 2 years was 1% or less in all subtypes except triple negative (1.6%). CONCLUSION: The risk of 5-year LR as a first event was low and decreased with the number of event-free years. After three event-free years, the overall risk was 1%. This is reassuring to patients and also suggests that follow-up beyond 3 years may produce low yield of LR, both for individual patients and studies using LR as primary outcome. This can be used as a starting point to tailor follow-up to individual needs.",

Studies were carried out in 11 consecutive term newborns with encephalopathy probably caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury. The clinical evaluation included pregnancy data, labor conditions, encephalopathy grade, presence of seizures, and necessity of antiepileptic drug therapy. Polygraphic recordings were obtained in all cases. Interest areas evaluated by spectroscopy were the basal ganglia and thalami. Among the cases, N-acetylaspartate/creatine, choline/creatine, and lactate/creatine ratios were calculated and related to the clinical variables, polygraphic recordings, and 6-month neurodevelopmental outcome. Abnormal follow-up occurred in 5 of 11 patients (45.4%) and was clearly related to an Apgar score <5 at 5 minutes (P = 0.003), encephalopathy grade (P = 0.02), early neonatal seizures (P = 0.02), and antiepileptic therapy (P = 0.01). No relationship was observed between spectroscopy results and polygraphic recordings profile. The lowest mean N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio was observed in four of five patients with an adverse outcome and, although not statistically significant, demonstrated a clear trend to unfavorable follow-up (t test = 0.06). The choline/creatine ratios could not be related to follow-up in our sample. The most consistently observed abnormality on the spectra was the presence of the lactate peak in four of five patients with unfavorable outcome, with a high relative risk to determine evolution in the sample, relative risk 7.0 (chi2 = 0.01, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-42.9).",

        "a": "Suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is a common diagnostic challenge for physicians in neurology, stroke, general medicine and primary care. It is essential to identify TIAs promptly because of the very high early risk of ischaemic stroke, requiring urgent investigation and preventive treatment. On the other hand, it is also important to identify TIA 'mimics', to avoid unnecessary and expensive investigations, incorrect diagnostic labelling and inappropriate long-term prevention treatment. Although the pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke and TIA is identical, and both require rapid and accurate diagnosis, the differential diagnosis differs for TIA owing to the transience of symptoms. For TIA the diagnostic challenge is greater, and the 'mimic' rate higher (and more varied), because there is no definitive diagnostic test. TIA heralds a high risk of early ischaemic stroke, and in many cases the stroke can be prevented if the cause is identified, hence the widespread dissemination of guidelines including rapid assessment and risk tools like the ABCD2 score. However, these guidelines do not emphasise the substantial challenges in making the correct diagnosis in patients with transient neurological symptoms. In this article we will mainly consider the common TIA mimics, but also briefly mention the rather less common situations where TIAs can look like something else ('chameleons').",

Materials and Methods: From 2004 to 2021, a total of 258 patients underwent repair of A-AAD; patients were equally distributed among three periods: 2004-2010 (Era 1, n = 90), 2011-2016 (Era 2, n = 87), and 2017-2021 (Era 3, n = 81). The primary end-point was to assess whether through the years changes in indications, surgical strategies and techniques and increasing experience have influenced early and late outcomes of A-AAD repair. Results: Axillary artery cannulation was almost routinely used in Eras 2 (86%) and 3 (91%) while one femoral artery was mainly cannulated in Era 1 (91%) (p < 0.01). Retrograde cerebral perfusion was predominantly used in Era 1 (60%) while antegrade cerebral perfusion was preferred in Eras 2 (94%,) and 3 (100%); (p < 0.01). There was a significant increase of arch replacement procedures from Era 1 (11%) to Eras 2 (33%) and 3 (48%) (p < 0.01). A frozen elephant trunk was mainly performed in Era 3. Hospital mortality was 13% in Era 1, 11% in Era 2, and 4% in Era 3 (p = 0.07). Actuarial survival at 3 years is 74%, in Era 1, 78% in Era 2, and 89% in Era 3 (p = 0.05). Conclusions: With increasing experience and a more aggressive approach, including total arch replacement, repair of A-AAD can be performed with low operative mortality in many patients. Patient care and treatment by a specific team organization allows a faster diagnosis and referral for surgery allowing to further improve early and late outcomes.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) as a member of the TNF gene superfamily induces apoptosis primarily in tumor cells. TRAIL also plays an important role in the modulation of inflammatory responses, especially in the process of immune paralysis. The aim of the present study was to examine soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) levels in septic patients in an attempt to explore the association between sTRAIL level and the risk of mortality. METHODS: Plasma sTRAIL levels were detected by ELISA in 50 septic patients and 20 healthy volunteers. HLA-DR expression in monocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Selective biochemical parameters were recorded, and patients were monitored in a 28-day period for mortality. RESULTS: The mean plasma sTRAIL level in septic patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (16.9\u00b18.3 vs. 68.3\u00b18.6 pg/ml, P<0.01), and was significantly higher in 28-day survivors than those in non-survivors (19.4\u00b19.8 vs. 13.9\u00b14.7 pg/ml, P<0.05). Univariate analysis indicated that plasma sTRAIL level was positively correlated with monocyte and lymphocyte counts and HLA-DR expression level (r\u200a=\u200a0.5, P<0.01; r\u200a=\u200a0.3, P<0.05; r\u200a=\u200a0.43, P<0.01, respectively). STRAIL level was negatively correlated with APACHE II score, BUN and age (r\u200a=\u200a-0.48, P<0.01; r\u200a=\u200a-0.29, P<0.05; r\u200a=\u200a-0.45, P<0.01, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the predictor of plasma soluble TRAIL level was HLA-DR expression (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Low plasma sTRAIL levels were associated with immune paralysis and a high risk of mortality in patients with septic shock. sTRAIL may prove to be a potential biomarker of immune function and predict the survival of septic patients.",

        "a": "T cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs) are aggressive malignancies which have a high risk of life-threatening complications. However, their prognosis in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting has not yet been assessed. We conducted a study including 87 ICU patients either with newly diagnosed T-NHLs or those undergoing first-line therapy admitted between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2014. The primary subtypes were peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) (n\u00a0=\u200941, 47%), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n\u00a0=\u200913, 15%), and adult T-leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (n\u00a0=\u200911, 13%). Six in every ten patients had malignancy-related complications (haemophagocytic syndrome 37%, tumour lysis syndrome 18% and hypercalcaemia 9%), while infections accounted for one quarter of ICU admissions. Nine fungal infections were documented, including six invasive aspergillosis. Urgent chemotherapy was started in the ICU in 59% of the patients, and urgent surgery was required in 13%. ICU and day-90 mortality were 22% and 41%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SOFA score at day 1, age, sepsis and haemophagocytic syndrome were independent predictors of day-90 mortality. Compared to 66 ICU-matched controls with non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas, patients with T-NHLs had a similar ICU survival. Overall survival rates of patients with T cell NHLs and B cell NHLs were 20% and 46%, respectively (hazard ratio for death associated with T cell NHLs 2.00 [1.12-3.58]). Patients with T cell NHLs had a very poor long-term outcome. Although the high rate of short-term survival suggests that an ICU trial is a reasonable option for patients newly diagnosed for the malignancy, extended stay in the ICU or further readmission should be considered only for highly selected patients who respond to the haematological treatment.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Children discharged from emergency departments (EDs) are often at risk for ED return. The objective was to identify risk factors and interventions to mitigate or prevent ED return among this patient population. METHODS: Structured literature review of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were studies evaluating ED returns by identifying risk factors and interventions in the pediatric population. Emergency department return was defined as returning to the ED within 1 year after initial visit. Abstract and full text articles were reviewed, and data were abstracted by 2 independent authors. RESULTS: A total of 963 articles were screened and yielded 42 potential relevant articles involving pediatric population. After full text review, a total of 12 articles were included in the final analysis (6 on risk factors and 6 on interventions). Risk factors for pediatric ED return included behavioral/psychiatric problems, younger age, acuity of illness, medical history of asthma, and social factors. Interventions included computer-generated instructions, postdischarge telephone coaching, ED-made appointments, case management, and home environment intervention. Emergency department-made appointments and postdischarge telephone coaching plus monetary incentive improved outpatient follow-up rate but not ED return. Home environment assessment coupled with case management reduced ED returns specifically among asthma patients. CONCLUSIONS: Several patient and visit characteristics can help predict children at risk for ED return. Although some interventions are successful at improving postdischarge follow-up, most did not reduce ED returns.",

        "a": "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine and describe the relationship between physiological status and violent and aggressive behaviours in hospital patients. BACKGROUND: The majority of adverse events are preceded by physiological abnormalities; whether physiological deterioration is a predictor of violent or aggressive behaviours remains unknown. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. METHODS: Prospective audit of 999 patients from two major health services in Melbourne, Australia. There were 333 cases who required an emergency response for aggressive or violent behaviour (Code Grey) in the emergency department, medical or surgical units, or inpatient mental health unit between January-June 2015. Two control patients who did not have a Code Grey were randomly selected from the same unit and same day that the Code Grey occurred for the case patient. RESULTS: Patient locations were 54\u00b74% medical or surgical units, 23\u00b77% emergency department and 21\u00b79% mental health units. Code Grey patients had less documentation of physiological assessment and were more likely to have respiratory rate, heart rate and conscious state abnormalities in the 12\u00a0hours preceding Code Grey. After adjusting for confounders, the risk of Code Grey was highest for patients with confusion. CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing behavioural disturbance had lower standards of patient assessment, greater incidence of physiological abnormalities and more inpatient deaths. Early recognition of, and response to, patient and physiological predictors of Code Grey should be a strategy to prevent behavioural escalation to the point of Code Grey. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Strategies are needed to improve physiological assessment of patients with behavioural disturbance while ensuring staff safety. There are patient and physiological factors associated with increased risk of Code Grey that may be used to prevent behavioural escalation to the point of an emergency response.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates critical pathways of hepatic metabolism, inflammation, and gut mucosal barrier. Thus, we investigated the association of FXR-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. METHODS: Two FXR-SNPs (rs56163822 G\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs35724 G\u00a0>\u00a0C) were genotyped in a cohort of 402 prospectively characterized patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u2265\u00a06\u00a0mmHg. RESULTS: Only 19 patients (4.7%) harbored a rs56163822 T-allele and had less pronounced liver disease as indicated by lower Child-Pugh score (CPS, 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 vs 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 points, P\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and higher albumin levels (38.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 vs 35.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0g/L, P\u00a0=\u00a00.026). In contrast, n\u00a0=\u00a0267 (66.4%) patients harbored minor rs35724 allele (G/C or C/C) and had more advanced liver disease, as indicated by a higher model of end-stage liver disease (11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 vs 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), while other baseline characteristics were similar across FXR-SNP genotypes. In compensated CPS-A patients, the rs35724 minor allele was independently protective for the development of ascites (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]\u00a0=\u00a00.411, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.191-0.885; P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and tended to reduce the risk of hepatic decompensation (aHR\u00a0=\u00a00.625, 95% CI: 0.374-1.044, P\u00a0=\u00a00.072) in multivariate analyses. Of note, transplant-free survival was longer in patients with rs35724 minor allele and HVPG\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0mmHg (at 5\u00a0years: 68.2% vs 55.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.047) and those with HVPG\u00a0\u2265\u00a016\u00a0mmHg (63.3% vs 44.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).

        "a": "Objective: The prevalence of colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) has increased over the last decade, reaching levels as high as 23% in certain patient populations. Active surveillance cultures (ASC) represent a valuable tool to identify patients colonized with MDRO to apply preventive measures, reduce transmission, and guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. There is a paucity of data evaluating the impact of admission ASCs to predict future infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concordance between ASCs results and the development of clinical infection by the same microorganism identified in the surveillance swab (\"swab-related infection\"), in hospitalized septic patients, and to evaluate the presence of specific risk factors associated with the development of a swab-related infection. Methods: All adults admitted to the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Medicine Department of the University Hospital Campus Bio-Medico of Rome with a diagnosis of infection or any other medical reason with admission surveillance swabs (rectal or nasal) between January 2018 and February 2021 were included in the study. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients that developed infections with concordant MDROs identified on ASC, and the risk factors for swab-related infection. Secondary outcomes were need of intensive care unit transfer, length of stay, sepsis or septic shock development, and all-cause mortality. Results: A total of 528 patients were included in the study, of which 97 (18.3%) had a positive surveillance swab. Among patients with positive surveillance swabs, 18 (18.5%) developed an infection with the same microorganism recovered from the swab, 57 (58.8%) developed an infection with a different microorganism than that recovered from the surveillance swab, and 22 (22.7%) did not develop an infection during hospitalization. The number of colonized sites, an interventional procedure within the previous 3 months, a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score \u2265 2, and a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (q-SOFA) score \u2265 2 were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing a swab-related infection. SIRS and q-SOFA scores \u2265 2 and procalcitonin \u2265 0.43 ng/ml help for identifying patients with a swab-related infection. Conclusion: Patients with positive surveillance swabs were at increased risk for development of infections by the same MDRO identified in surveillance swabs (swab-related infection). This study is the first to show that the positivity of surveillance swabs, in combination with anamnestic data, PCT values, and SIRS or q-SOFA scores, serves as a valuable tool to help clinicians predict patients at higher risk for swab-related infection development and guide the administration of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy in septic patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Stage II rectal cancers comprise a heterogeneous group, and there is significant variability in practise with regards to adjuvant chemotherapy; the survival benefit of chemotherapy is perceived to be <4% in these patients. However, in recent years, the emergence of additional prognostic factors such as extramural venous invasion (EMVI) suggests that there may be sub-stratification of stage II tumours and, further, we may be under-estimating the benefit adjuvant chemotherapy provides in high-risk patients. This study examined the outcomes of patients with stage II and III rectal cancer to determine whether EMVI status influences disease-free survival (DFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of a prospectively maintained database was conducted of patients presenting with rectal cancer between 2006 and 2012. All patients underwent curative surgery and had no evidence of metastases at presentation. Clinicopathological factors were compared between stage II and III disease. The primary end point was 3-year DFS; univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out using Cox proportional hazards regression models; hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-eight patients were included: 233 stage II; 245 stage III. The prevalence of EMVI was 34.9%; 57 stage II patients (24.5%) and 110 stage III patients (44.9%). On multivariate analysis, only EMVI status was a significant factor for DFS. The adjusted HR for EMVI either alone or in combination with nodal involvement was 2.08 (95% CI 1.10-2.95) and 2.74 (95% CI 1.66-4.52), respectively. CONCLUSION: EMVI is an independently poor prognostic factor for DFS for both stage II and stage III rectal cancer. These results demonstrate that there is risk-stratification within stage II tumours which affects prognosis. When discussing the use of adjuvant chemotherapy with patients that have EMVI-positive stage II tumours, these results provide evidence for a similarly increased risk of distant failure as stage III disease without venous invasion.",

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the risks of osteopenia (OPe) and osteoporosis (OP) in psoriasis. Methods: A systematic search was performed for published studies evaluating cutaneous Ps and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) compared with healthy control groups utilizing a validated bone mineral density (BMD) assessment score. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model; pooled estimates and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For analysis, Ps and PsA groups were combined due to the small number of studies. Results: Twenty-one studies were included for final analysis; three Ps only, 15 PsA and three both. There was a significant difference between psoriatic disease (combination Ps and PsA group) compared with controls relating to an association with OP/OPe, with an overall odds ratio (OR) of 1.71 (95% CI 1.07-2.74: p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.026). The Ps group had significantly lower BMD than the control group at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck (mean difference -0.04; 95% CI -0.090 to 0.002 and -0.03; 95% CI -0.059 to 0.003 respectively). Conclusion: Putative risks of OPe and OP in both Ps and PsA are supported but not confirmed. Significant heterogeneity of reported data limits definitive conclusions in this meta-analysis. This review contributes to the further understanding of Ps as a multisystem disease and future management of potential comorbidities, but highlights key gaps in the literature. Further studies addressing standardised OP reporting, specific disease group characteristics comparing Ps with PsA, patient characteristics and medication use, are required in order to make more certain conclusions with greater clinical impact.",

        "a": "The course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies from individual to individual. People of advanced age with comorbidities have been identified as having a higher risk for severe disease or to die from COVID-19. Frailty is an essential risk factor in this respect. Approximately one fifth of the middle European population are older than 65\u00a0years, and of these 10-15% can be categorized as frail. The pandemic brings the healthcare systems in many countries to their limits. Deciding which patients should be transferred to intensive care units (ICU) raises ethical discussions. In some countries the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is used to support this decision. Patients over 80\u00a0years of age suffering from COVID-19 show a\u00a03.6-fold increase in the risk of mortality compared to the group aged 18-49\u00a0years. The risk of frail (CFS scores\u00a06-9) patients is three times higher than for robust patients (CFS scores\u00a01-3). A\u00a0CFS score cut-off \u2265\u202f6 clearly correlates with mortality of COVID-19 patients older than 65\u00a0years. Additionally, mid-term and long-term survival is determined by the degree of frailty at the time before COVID-19 rather than by the severity of the disease. Patients over 60\u00a0years are particularly at risk to develop a rapid loss of muscle mass during moderate or severe COVID-19. Patients being treated on ICUs lose 20-30% of their thigh extensor muscle mass within 10\u00a0days. The extent of sarcopenia associated with COVID-19 is decisive in determining the course of the disease and makes individually tailored rehabilitation programs necessary. Up to 50% of hospitalized patients need further rehabilitation after discharge. Aerobic training of low intensity combined with resistance training as well as a\u00a0sufficient supply of calories and proteins in the diet are essential in this respect.",

Delirious patients are at greater risk of negative health outcomes and their care is often more costly. Aim.\u2002 To determine the feasibility of a full-scale trial to test the effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve delirium prevention, detection and intervention in an acute care hospital. Design.\u2002 A delirium prevention protocol was designed by an interdisciplinary group of clinicians and implemented on intervention unit patients who passed a mental status screen, were at high risk for delirium according to the modified NEECHAM scale, and met other eligibility criteria. These patients were reviewed at daily interdisciplinary team meetings and team recommendations were placed in the patient's chart. On the usual care unit, physicians were notified if their patients were at high risk, but the delirium protocol was not implemented. Methods.\u2002 The delirium protocol was pilot tested with 35 high risk patients on an Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit. Outcomes were compared to 35 high risk patients on a similar medical unit without the delirium protocol. Results.\u2002 The main outcome examined whether there is a difference in average day 3 modified NEECHAM scores comparing the intervention and control groups. The mean modified NEECHAMs on day 3 were not statistically significantly different (intervention group 3.76 and control group 3.24) (P=\u20030.368). Baseline NEECHAM scores did not correlate well with development of delirium (P\u2003=\u20030.204).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article was to communicate our experience with point-of-care testing (POCT) using Bayer's A1CNow+ device to test glycated hemoglobin (A1C) in the management of diabetes and to share the observations of our quality control efforts. METHODS: Forty-seven patients' POCT samples were compared with laboratory samples to determine the validity of the POCT sample being drawn. Data collected represent a 10-month time period that were drawn on-site with the following distribution: 36 samples were drawn the same day, 7 samples were drawn 1 day later, 3 samples were drawn within 3 days, and 1 sample was drawn 4 days later. Although all samples were collected on-site, some of the samples were sent to other local branches of nationally recognized laboratories for analysis. RESULTS: The range of A1C results for the POCT group was 5.6 to >13%. The range of A1C results for the laboratory-drawn group was 5 to 12.6%. Twenty-four patients had laboratory results that read lower than the result obtained in the clinic, with an A1C range of 5 to 12.6%, and two patients had laboratory results that read exactly the same as the result obtained in the clinic when using POCT. These two individuals had A1C results of 9.1 and 12.6%. Analysis of data collected determined an r value of 0.918 demonstrating agreement between the POCT samples and the laboratory samples. CONCLUSIONS: POCT with the A1CNow+ is an effective, economical tool for use in a pharmacist-based diabetes clinic that serves a high-risk underserved population. POCT allows the pharmacist the ability to use on-site results to inform patients of their progress, modify their therapy immediately with an immediate face-to-face opportunity to assure understanding, and provide a self-management goal.",

        "a": "The main objectives of the present study were to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) to predict clinical relapse and guide preemptive treatment with rituximab. Among the patients enrolled in 2 prospective trials by the Nordic Lymphoma Group, 183 who had completed autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and in whom an MRD marker had been obtained were included in our analysis. Fresh samples of bone marrow were analyzed for MRD by a combined standard nested and quantitative real-time PCR assay for Bcl-1/immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) and clonal IgH rearrangements. Significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was demonstrated for patients who were MRD positive pre-ASCT (54 patients) or in the first analysis post-ASCT (23 patients). The median PFS was only 20 months in those who were MRD-positive in the first sample post-ASCT, compared with 142 months in the MRD-negative group (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). OS was 75% at 10 years and median not reached in the MRD-negative group, compared with only 35 months in the MRD-positive group (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Of the 86 patients (47%) who remained in continuous molecular remission, 73% were still in clinical remission after 10 years. For all patients, the median time from ASCT to first molecular relapse was 55 months, with a continuous occurrence of late molecular relapses. Fifty-eight patients who experienced MRD relapse received rituximab as preemptive treatment on 1 or more occasions, and in this group, the median time from first molecular relapse to clinical relapse was 55 months. In most cases, rituximab converted patients to MRD negativity (87%), but many patients became MRD-positive again later during follow-up (69%). By multivariate analysis, high-risk Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score and positive MRD status pre-ASCT predicted early molecular relapse. In conclusion, preemptive rituximab treatment converts patients to MRD negativity and likely postpones clinical relapse. Molecular monitoring offers an opportunity to select some patients for therapeutic intervention and to avoid unnecessary treatment in others. MRD-positive patients in the first analysis post-ASCT have a dismal prognosis and thus are in need of novel strategies.",

        "a": "Background: Owing to the heterogeneity displayed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME), it is noted that the long-term effectiveness of the cancer therapy poses a severe clinical challenge. Hence, it is essential to categorize and alter the treatment intervention decisions for these tumors. Materials and methods: \"ConsensusClusterPlus\" tool was used for developing a secure molecular classification system that was based on the cuproptosis-linked gene expression. Furthermore, all clinical properties, pathway characteristics, genomic changes, and immune characteristics of different cell types involved in the immune pathways were also assessed. Univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analyses were used for designing the prognostic risk model associated with cuproptosis. Results: Three cuproptosis-linked subtypes (clust1, clust2, and clust3) were detected. Out of these, Clust3 showed the worst prognosis, followed by clust2, while Clust1 showed the best prognosis. Three subtypes had significantly different enrichment in pathways related to Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, cell cycle, and cell senescence (p < 0.01). The clust3 subtype with poor prognosis had a low \"ImmuneScore\" and low immune cell infiltration, and the three subtypes had significant differences in the antigen processing and presentation pathway of the macrophages. Clust1 had a low TIDE score and was sensitive to immunotherapy. Then, according to the prognosis-related genes of cuproptosis, a prognosis risk model related to cuproptosis was constructed, containing seven genes (KIF2C, PTTG1, CENPM, CDC20, CYP2C9, SFN, and CFHR3). \"High\" group had a higher TIDE score compared to the TIDE score value shown by the \"Low\" group, which benefited less from immunotherapy, whereas the \"High\" group patients were more sensitive to the conventional drugs. Finally, the prognosis risk model related to cuproptosis was combined with clinical pathological characteristics to further improve the prognostic model and survival prediction. Conclusion: Three new molecular subgroups based on cuproptosis-linked genes were revealed, and a cuproptosis-related prognostic risk model comprising seven genes was established in this study, which could assist in predicting the prognosis and identifying the patients benefit from immunotherapy.",

        "a": "AIMS: Although heart failure (HF) is a leading cause for hospitalization and mortality, normalized and comparable non-invasive assessment of haemodynamics and myocardial action remains limited. Moreover, myocardial deformation has not been compared between the guideline-defined HF entities. The distribution of affected and impaired segments within the contracting left ventricular (LV) myocardium have also not been compared. Therefore, we assessed myocardial function impairment by strain in patients with HF and control subjects by magnetic resonance imaging after clinically phenotyping these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study conducted at two centres in Germany between 2017 and 2018 enrolled stable outpatient subjects with HF [n\u00a0=\u00a056, including HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)] and a control cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Parameters assessed included measures for external myocardial function, for example, cardiac index and myocardial deformation measurements by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), the global circumferential strain (GCS) and the regional distribution of segment deformation within the LV myocardium, as well as basic phenotypical characteristics. Comparison of the cardiac indices at rest showed no differences neither between the HF groups nor between the control group and HF patients (one-way ANOVA P\u00a0=\u00a00.70). The analysis of the strain data revealed differences between all groups in both LV GLS (One-way ANOVA: P\u00a0<\u00a00.01. Controls vs. HFpEF: -20.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.62 vs. -19.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25. HFpEF vs. HFmrEF: -19.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25 vs. -15.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.76. HFmrEF vs. HFrEF: -15.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.76 vs. -11.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.97.) and LV GCS (One-way ANOVA: P\u00a0<\u00a00.01. Controls vs. HFpEF: -19.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.18 vs. -17.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10. HFpEF vs. HFmrEF: -17.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10 vs. -12.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.47. HFrEF: -11.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.27). Comparing the segment deformation distribution patterns highlighted the discriminating effect between the groups was much more prominent between the groups (one-way ANOVA P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) when compared by a score combining regional effects and a global view on the LV. Further analyses of the patterns among the segments affected showed that while the LVEF is preserved in HFpEF, the segments impaired in their contractility are located in the ventricular septum. The worse the LVEF is, the more segments are affected, but the septum remains an outstanding location with the most severe contractility impairment throughout the HF entities. CONCLUSIONS: While cardiac index at rest did not differ significantly between controls and stable HF patients suffering from HFrEF, HFmrEF, or HFpEF, the groups did differ significantly in LV GLS and LV GCS values. Regional strain analysis revealed that the LV septum is the location affected most, with reduced values already visible in HFpEF and further reductions in HFmrEF and HFrEF.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Antiviral therapy can prevent the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. However, HCC still develops in patients achieving sustained virological response (SVR). We proposed to evaluate the risk factors and derive a novel risk score for HCC (score(HCC)) by summation of products of clinical weights based on the regression coefficients in the final proportional hazards model. METHODS: From March 2002 to October 2009, we enrolled 871 patients with biopsy-proven CHC, who received combined pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and achieved SVR. RESULTS: Cox regression analysis showed that old age [hazard ratio (HR) 3.82, 95% CI 1.74-8.37, P\u200a=\u200a0.001], high \u03b1-fetoprotein levels (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.60-6.19, P\u200a=\u200a0.001), low platelet counts (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.22-6.44, P\u200a=\u200a0.015) and high fibrotic stage (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.46-10.70, P\u200a=\u200a0.007) were independent risk factors. The cut-off level of risk scores was a derived value of 10 and was able to predict the HCC risk with 89.2% sensitivity and 69.5% specificity. The AUC value for the prediction was 0.848. The score(HCC) values were further categorized into three risk groups: low risk (score(HCC) \u226410), intermediate risk (score(HCC) 11-15) and high risk (score(HCC) \u226516). The proportion of HCC development increased from 1.37% (9/657) in the low-risk group to 9.14% (16/175) in the intermediate-risk group and 30.77% (12/39) in the high-risk group (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: With the novel risk scores, we can estimate the chance of HCC development more exactly and practically. This approach can be used for HCC screening in CHC patients achieving SVR.",

The underlying cause of LUTS in middle-aged and elderly men is an improperly functioning voiding mechanism of the bladder associated with ageing. Symptoms are not simply due to prostate enlargement. In uncomplicated LUTS the patient's perception of the level of inconvenience is very important in considering and choosing therapeutic options. Percussion of the bladder after micturition is no longer universally advised. In general, invasive treatment is more effective in relieving symptoms than medical treatment, although invasive treatment causes more adverse effects. LUTS and prostate cancer are different entities, and LUTS is not a risk factor for prostate cancer. The issue of prostate cancer is discussed in this practice guideline in order to clear up popular misconceptions and to enhance the practical implementation of this guideline.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of resource use and costs of a medical intensive care unit (ICU) utilising the simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28). DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: : Medical ICU of a tertiary care centre. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with an ICU length of stay (LOS) more than 24 h. INTERVENTIONS: Over a 3 month period SAPS II, TISS-28 and SOFA were determined daily. Patients were retrospectively classified as receiving active (AT) or non-active (NAT) treatment according to TISS-28 variables, with AT representing a therapeutic intervention that could not be performed outside the ICU. Individual expenditure for all patients was calculated using a modified 'top-down' method. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Out of 303 consecutive patients, 241 (79.5%), including all non-survivors, were categorised AT. The hospital mortality was 14.5%. TISS-28 and ICU LOS were higher in patients receiving AT ( p<0.001). Patient-specific costs accounted for 36 EUR per TISS-point and daily treatment costs 1336 EUR for all patients. Daily costs of care were 68 EUR higher for AT, compared to NAT, patients ( p<0.001). There was no association between ICU costs and measures of severity of illness (SAPS II, SOFA). CONCLUSIONS: TISS-28 is a fast, reliable and readily applicable tool to identify patients receiving AT. Although total and daily costs of care were significantly higher in patients receiving AT, the difference of the daily costs was, albeit statistically significant, economically negligible. The main difference in ICU costs was attributable to ICU LOS. Therefore cost-saving strategies must aim at reducing ICU LOS, without compromising quality of care.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: Generalized competing event (GCE) models improve stratification of patients according to their risk of cancer events relative to competing causes of mortality. The potential impact of such methods on clinical trial power and cost, however, is uncertain. We sought to test the hypothesis that GCE models can reduce estimated clinical trial cost in elderly patients with cancer. METHODS: Patients with nonmetastatic head and neck (n = 9,677), breast (n = 22,929), or prostate cancer (n = 51,713) were sampled from the SEER-Medicare database. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared risk scores for all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) with GCE-based risk scores for each disease. We applied a cost function to estimate the cost and duration of clinical trials with a primary end point of overall survival in each population and in high-risk subpopulations. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: For the purpose of enriching subpopulations, GCE models reduced estimated clinical trial cost compared with Cox models of ACM and CSM in all disease sites. The relative cost reductions with GCE models compared with ACM and CSM models, respectively, were -68.4% and -14.4% in prostate cancer, -38.8% and -18.3% in breast cancer, and -17.1% and -4.1% in head and neck cancer. Cost savings in breast and prostate cancers were on the order of millions of dollars. The GCE model also reduced relative clinical trial duration compared with CSM and ACM models for all disease sites. The optimal risk score cutoff for clinical trial enrollment occurred near the top tertile for all disease sites. CONCLUSION: GCE models have significant potential to improve clinical trial efficiency and reduce cost, with a potentially large impact in prostate and breast cancers.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically review Indian literature on delays in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We searched multiple sources for studies on delays in patients with pulmonary TB and those with chest symptoms. Studies were included if numeric data on any delay were reported. Patient delay was defined as the interval between onset of symptoms and the patient's first contact with a health care provider. Diagnostic delay was defined as the interval between the first consultation with a health care provider and diagnosis. Treatment delay was defined as the interval between diagnosis and initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Total delay was defined as time interval from the onset of symptoms until treatment initiation. RESULTS: Among 541 potential citations identified, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. Included studies used a variety of definitions for onset of symptoms and delays. Median estimates of patient, diagnostic and treatment delay were respectively 18.4 (IQR 14.3-27.0), 31.0 (IQR 24.5-35.4) and 2.5 days (IQR 1.9-3.6) for patients with TB and those with chest symptoms combined. The median total delay was 55.3 days (IQR 46.5-61.5). About 48% of all patients first consulted private providers; an average of 2.7 health care providers were consulted before diagnosis. Number and type of provider first consulted were the most important risk factors for delay. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to develop novel strategies for reducing patient and diagnostic delays and engaging first-contact health care providers.",

Approximately 80% of the cases are caused by the human Merkel cell polyomavirus, while the remaining 20% are induced by UV light leading to mutations. The standard treatment of metastatic MCC is the use of anti-PD-1/-PD-L1-immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as Pembrolizumab or Avelumab, which in comparison with conventional chemotherapy show better overall response rates and longer duration of responses in patients. Nevertheless, 50% of the patients do not respond or develop ICI-induced, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), due to diverse mechanisms, such as down-regulation of MHC complexes or the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Other immunotherapeutic options such as cytokines and pro-inflammatory agents or the use of therapeutic vaccination offer great ameliorations to ICI. Cytotoxic T-cells play a major role in the effectiveness of ICI, and tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells and their phenotype contribute to the clinical outcome.

However, obesity-related comorbidities have also been shown to be associated with poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether BMI or obesity-associated comorbidities contribute to elevated COVID-19 severity in non-elderly, hospitalized patients with elevated BMI (\u226525\u2009kg/m2 ). This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of 526 hospitalized, non-elderly adult (aged 18-64) COVID-19 patients with BMI \u226525\u2009kg/m2 in suburban New York from March 6 to May 11, 2020. The Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) was used to quantify the severity of obesity-related comorbidities. EOSS was compared with BMI in multivariable regression analyses to predict COVID-19 outcomes. We found that higher EOSS scores were associated with poor outcomes after demographic adjustment, unlike BMI. Specifically, patients with increased EOSS scores had increased odds of acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u00a0=\u00a06.40; 95% CI 3.71-11.05), intensive care unit admission (aOR\u00a0=\u00a010.71; 95% CI 3.23-35.51), mechanical ventilation (aOR\u00a0=\u00a03.10; 95% CI 2.01-4.78) and mortality (aOR\u00a0=\u00a05.05; 95% CI 1.83-13.90). Obesity-related comorbidity burden as determined by EOSS was a better predictor of poor COVID-19 outcomes relative to BMI, suggesting that comorbidity burden may be driving risk in those hospitalized with elevated BMI.",

Baseline MDS-UPDRS III score (24.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6 vs. 21.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.3. p\u00a0=\u00a00.4), response to LDC (39.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9% vs. 32.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.1), best ON score (36.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039.5% vs. 41.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.6) and LEDD (188\u00a0mg\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0mg vs. 261.8\u00a0mg\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0164.8\u00a0mg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.2) during the first six months after initiation of DRT were not different between GBA-PD and sporadic PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: At early disease stages of GBA-PD, the motor response to acute levodopa challenge test and the initial response to DRT are similar to that of patients with sporadic PD. Although limited by small sample size, these preliminary findings should be confirmed by future prospective larger studies.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a potentially fatal subcutaneous tissue and fascia infection. We studied the role of serum procalcitonin in the identification and assessment of severity of sepsis in patients with NF. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted from January 2000 to December 2013 for all patients who admitted to surgical intensive care with provisional diagnosis of NF. Patients were categorized into four groups based on the initial procalcitonin concentrations (Group I:\u2009<0.5 low risk, Group II:\u2009\u22650.5-<2 moderate risk, Group III: \u22652-<10 high risk, and Group IV: \u226510 ng/mL high likelihood of severe sepsis). RESULTS: During the study period, 331 cases were identified to have NF with a mean age of 51\u2009\u00b1\u200914 years. Serum procalcitonin was tested in 62 cases (only between 2011 and December 2013) and all were positive (Group I: 22%, Group II: 18%, Group III: 21%, and Group IV: 39%). The most common affected regions were thigh and chest in Group II (46% and 9%, respectively), lower limbs in Group III (46%), and perineum and abdomen in Group IV (25% and 21%, respectively). In the four groups, 21 patients developed septic shock (Group I: 0%, Group II: 14%, Group III: 24%, and Group IV: 62%). The cut off procalcitonin value for septic shock was 5.6\u2009ng/mL. Using receiver-operating characteristic curve, this cut off with the Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.77 was found to have sensitivity 81% and specificity 67%. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was substantially greater in Group III and Group IV in comparison to Group I and Group II, p\u2009=\u20090.006. Procalcitonin levels were correlated well with SOFA score (r\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.007). There were 17 deaths in the four groups (Group I: 6%, Group II: 23%, Group III: 12%, and Group IV: 59%). CONCLUSION: Initial procalcitonin concentration in NF carries an important prognostic value and it correlates well with SOFA score and can predict the development of septic shock early in patients with NF.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To test whether a system of screening, assessment, referral, and follow-up provided within primary care for high-risk older outpatients improves recognition of geriatric conditions and healthcare outcomes. DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial with 3-year follow-up; intervention versus control group allocation based on practice group assignment. SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ambulatory care center. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred ninety-two community-dwelling patients aged 65 and older identified by postal screening survey. INTERVENTION: The intervention combined a structured telephone geriatric assessment by a physician assistant, individualized referrals and recommendations, selected referral to outpatient geriatric assessment, and ongoing telephone case management. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcomes were VA medical record evidence of recognition and evaluation of target geriatric conditions (depression, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, falls, functional impairment), functional status (Functional Status Questionnaire, FSQ), and hospitalization (VA databases and self-reported non-VA usage). RESULTS: Intervention participants were more likely to have target conditions recognized, evaluated, and referred to specialized services within 12 months of enrollment, although there were no significant differences in FSQ scores or acute hospitalization between intervention and control groups at 1, 2, or 3 years follow-up. Subgroup analyses suggested improvements in depression symptoms and functional impairment at 1-year follow-up in intervention participants with these problems at baseline, but these findings were not evident at later follow-up. CONCLUSION: The intervention increased recognition and evaluation of target geriatric conditions but did not improve functional status or decrease hospitalization. Innovative screening methods can identify older people in need of geriatric services, but achieving measurable improvement in functional status or hospitalization rates will likely require a more-intensive intervention than a program involving primarily unsolicited referrals and short-term consultations.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: A blunted heart rate (HR) response is associated with an impaired peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), a powerful outcome predictor in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The present multicenter study sought to determine the prognostic role for exercise-induced HR response in HCM. METHODS: A total of 681 consecutive HCM outpatients on optimized treatment were recruited. The heart failure (HF) end-point was death due to HF, cardiac transplantation, NYHA III-IV class progression, HF worsening leading to hospitalization and severe functional deterioration leading to septal reduction. The sudden cardiac death (SCD) end-point included SCD, aborted SCD and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharges. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.2\u202fyears (25-75th centile: 3.9-5.2), 81 patients reached the HF and 23 the SCD end-point. Covariates with independent effects on the HF end-point were left atrial diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, maximal left ventricular outflow tract gradient and exercise cardiac power (ECP\u202f=\u202fpVO2\u2217systolic blood pressure) (C-Index\u202f=\u202f0.807) whereas the HCM Risk-SCD score and the ECP remained associated with the SCD end-point (C-Index\u202f=\u202f0.674). When the VO2-derived variables were not pursued, peak HR (pHR) re-entered in the multivariate HF model (C-Index\u202f=\u202f0.777) and, marginally, in the SCD model (C-index\u202f=\u202f0.656). A pHR\u202f=\u202f70% of the maximum predicted resulted as the best cut-off value in predicting the HF-related events. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiopulmonary exercise test is pivotal in the HCM management, however the pHR remains a meaningful alternative parameter. A pHR\u202f<\u202f70% identified a HCM population at high risk of HF-related events, thus calling for a reappraisal of the chronotropic incompetence threshold in HCM.",

RESULTS: After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, we found that the total safety score (adjusted odds ratio: 1.000, 95% confidence interval: 0.999-1.001) was not associated with hospital mortality. Computerized physician order entry and ICU physician staffing were also not associated with hospital mortality.

        "a": "BACKGROUND Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL-NT) is difficult to distinguish from nasal polyps and inverted papilloma, leading to its high misdiagnosis ratio. The aim of this study was to investigate its potential prognostic indicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate overall survival (OS) rate. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze risk ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Nasal ala infiltration and nasal floor thickness >2.0 mm or nasal septum thickness >2.5 mm were potential prognostic factors for OS (p=0.0323 and 0.0072, respectively). Cox proportional-hazards regression indicated that high LMP1 expression and the nasal floor thickness >2.0 mm or nasal septum thickness >2.5 mm were the independent risk factors for poor OS of ENKTL-NT (HR=3.0655, p=0.028; HR=2.3650, p=0.0452, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, the OS rate was lower when the nasal floor thickness >2.0 mm or nasal septum thickness >2.5 mm in the patients who had high expression of LMP1 (p=0.0651), whereas high LMP1 expression increased the risk of worse prognostic outcome in patients with deep infiltration thickness. Thus, high LMP1 expression may contribute to the tissue invasion of ENKTL-NT. CONCLUSIONS Any patient with nasal ala soft-tissue invasion, nasal floor thickness >2.0 mm/nasal septum thickness >2.5 mm on CT imaging or high LMP1 expression should prompt immediate histopathologic diagnosis to rule out ENKTL-NT in clinical practice.",

The aims of this study were to quantify flow restoration and the particle size distribution of the effluent pursuant to MET in an in vitro occlusion model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model system was composed of 3 elements: an ICA/MCA replica, a clot model with mechanical properties similar to those of thrombi found in patients at risk of stroke, and a pulsatile flow loop. Different thrombectomy mechanisms including mechanical retrieval, aspiration, and waveguide induced cavitation were used. The efficacy end points were recanalization rate and amount of flow restoration. The risk of the embolic shower was assessed to evaluate device safety. RESULTS: The recanalization rates were the following: Merci, 67%; Solitaire, 100%; Penumbra, 83%; Enterprise, 17%; and the waveguide, 0%. In experiments in which recanalization was achieved, the amount of flow restoration for the Merci, Solitaire, and Enterprise devices was 100%, 92%, and 86%, respectively. The mean sizes of generated small and large clot fragments were between 23 and 37 and 215 and 285 \u03bcm, respectively, depending on the device used. The Merci device generated the fewest number of large fragments compared with the Penumbra system (P < .05) and Solitaire (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of embolic shower was influenced by the mechanism of action for the thrombectomy device. Clinically reported recanalization rates for the Solitaire, Penumbra, and Merci devices were nearly identical in this model system, suggesting that this model may provide a predictive tool for preclinical evaluation of MET.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Activation of inflammatory pathways plays an important contributory role in coronary plaque instability and subsequent rupture, which can lead to the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Elevated levels of serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) represent independent risk factors for further cardiovascular events. Recent evidence indicates that in addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins also decrease levels of inflammatory markers. Previous controlled clinical trials reporting the positive effects of statins in participants with ACS were designed for very early secondary prevention. To our knowledge, no controlled trials have evaluated the potential benefits of statin therapy, beginning immediately at the time of hospital admission. A previous pilot study performed by our group focused on early initiation of cerivastatin therapy. We demonstrated a highly significant reduction in levels of inflammatory markers (CRP and interleukin-6). Based on these preliminary findings, we are conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of another statin, fluvastatin, as an early intervention in patients with ACS. METHODS: The FACS-trial (Fluvastatin in the therapy of Acute Coronary Syndrome) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of fluvastatin therapy initiated at the time of hospital admission. The study will enroll 1,000 participants admitted to hospital for ACS (both with and without ST elevation). The primary endpoint for the study is the influence of fluvastatin therapy on levels of inflammatory markers (CRP and interleukin-6) and on pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). A combined secondary endpoint is 30-day and one-year occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, recurrent symptomatic ischemia, urgent revascularization, and cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION: The primary objective of the FACS trial is to demonstrate that statin therapy, when started immediately after hospital admission for ACS, results in reduction of inflammation and improvement of prognosis. This study may contribute to new knowledge regarding therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from ACS and may offer additional clinical indications for the use of statins.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is incurable, with most patients surviving less than 3 years. However, many treatments that extend survival have been approved in the past decade. OBJECTIVE: To describe the patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in a cohort of Veterans diagnosed with mCRPC in the Veterans Health Administration. DESIGN: We identified 3,637 Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 2006 and August 2015 with evidence of mCRPC through December 2016. We described the most commonly used systemic mCRPC treatments according to mCRPC diagnosis era: Epoch 1 (2006-2010) or Epoch 2 (2011-2016). Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment patterns were examined using descriptive statistics. An unadjusted Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median time to biochemical progression and overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The median age at initial prostate cancer diagnosis was 68 years. Approximately 67% of patients were non-Hispanic white, 29% were black, and 4% were other/unknown. A high-risk Gleason score (8-10) was reported in 748 (67%) of patients in Epoch 1 and 1578 (63%) of patients in Epoch 2, and the median prostate-specific antigen level at initial prostate cancer diagnosis was higher in Epoch 1 patients than in Epoch 2 patients (68 vs. 35 ng/ml). Following mCRPC diagnosis, the most common first-line therapies in Epoch 1 patients were docetaxel (83%) and abiraterone (9%), whereas Epoch 2 patients mainly received abiraterone (47%), docetaxel (36%), and enzalutamide (15%). In Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 patients, the median time to biochemical progression (unadjusted) was 9 and 13 months, respectively, and the median OS (unadjusted) was 15 and 23 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of new therapies has resulted in increased use of the noncytotoxic agents abiraterone and enzalutamide as first-line treatment in lieu of docetaxel. Our results suggest that more recently diagnosed patients (Epoch 2) have a delayed time to biochemical progression and longer OS (unadjusted) compared with patients diagnosed earlier (Epoch 1).",

METHODS: A total of 65 patients with acute ischemic stroke at our hospital during the period of April 2011 to April 2013, selected in accordance with the established CTP or TTW standard (0 to 3.0 h and 3.0 to 4.5 h) for IVT were included for analysis. The primary endpoint events were Barthel index (BI) and the rate of serious adverse events at 14 days post-onset. The latter included mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). And secondary indicators included the incidence of reperfusion, recanalization, ICH and neurological improvement at Day 14, as well as time indicators, such as onset-to-door time (ODT), door-to-treatment time (DTT) and onset-to-treatment time (OTT). Statistical calculations for continuous variables were compared with t or Mann-Whitney U test. And other comparisons were made with Pearson Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Twenty-five and 40 cases with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled according to CTP or TTW standard for IVT respectively. Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, risk factors, blood pressure, blood sugar, National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and drug dose showed no significant difference among groups. DTT and OTT in CTP group were significantly longer than those of the 0 to 3.0 h subgroup, while similar with those of the 3.0 to 4.5 h subgroup. Interestingly, consistent with a significant higher rate of transferring for consultation in the CTP group comparing with the TTW group (52.0% vs 25.0%, P = 0.03), the rate was also significantly higher than the 0 to 3.0 h subgroup (52.0% vs 7.7%, P = 0.02), but not significantly higher than the 3.0 to 4.5 subgroup. Both primary endpoint events and secondary outcome measures among three groups showed no significant differences. As for secondary outcome measures, CTP group had a higher recanalization than the 3.0 to 4.5 h subgroup (52.0% vs 37.0%, P = 0.28) and there was a trend toward significance. CTP excluded 58 cases, including 20 proved cases of malignant infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: CTP is able to select reasonable candidates for IVT in an extended time window with effectiveness and safety comparable to TTW standard. Furthermore, it is quicker and more sensitive than TTW standard in detecting malignant infarction.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective, single-center observation study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of once-a-day ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, including treatment. RESULTS: Antiretroviral treatment of 23 children and adolescents with a median age of 16 years (range, 10-19 years) was changed to a single daily dose of a combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and 2 other nucleoside or nonnucleoside analogs. The single daily dosing was expected to improve adherence to treatment. The mean follow-up period was 12 months (range, 6-17 months). At the time of the treatment switch, the previous treatment had been effective in 11 children (plasma viral load [pVL] <50 copies/mL) and not effective in 12 (pVL >50 copies/mL). None of the viral genotypes had resistance to atazanavir. The susceptibility score for the drugs used in combination with atazanavir (GSS) was at least 1.5 in 12 of 20 children. The atazanavir dose was 300 mg per day for children weighing more than 50 kg and 200 mg per day for children weighing 30 to 50 kg, in all cases associated with 100 mg ritonavir. During follow up, the mean atazanavir plasma concentration at 12 to 15 hours was 2.18 +/- 1.19 mg/L. Tolerance was good in most patients, but 4 children chose to stop treatment because of icterus (n = 2) or persistent nausea and vomiting (n = 2). In 6 of the 12 children in whom treatment was not virologically effective before the switch, pVL was below 50 copies/mL after 1 to 3 months of treatment. Poor compliance and virologic failure persisted in the other 6 children. Seven of the 11 children with good virologic control before the switch continued to have undetectable pVL but 4 experienced virologic failure after 1, 1, 3 or 12 months of treatment despite good compliance. Insufficient antiviral potency of associated drugs could have been the cause of 2 of these 4 unexpected virologic failures. CONCLUSION: In these children with extensive previous treatment, the change to a once-daily treatment, including ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, was associated with a significant risk of virologic failure.",

Patients were classified depending on whether they had received a blood transfusion at any time during their ICU stay. RESULTS: Of 3,147 patients, 1,040 (33.0%) received a blood transfusion. These patients were older (mean age, 62 vs. 60 yr; P = 0.035) and were more likely to have liver cirrhosis or hematologic cancer, to be a surgical admission, and to have sepsis. They had a longer duration of ICU stay (5.9 vs. 2.5 days; P < 0.001) and a higher ICU mortality rate (23.0 vs. 16.3%; P < 0.001) but were also more severely ill on admission (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 40.2 vs. 34.7; P < 0.001; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 6.5 vs. 4.5; P < 0.001). There was a direct relation between the number of blood transfusions and the mortality rate, but in multivariate analysis, blood transfusion was not significantly associated with a worse mortality rate. Moreover, in 821 pairs matched according to a propensity score, there was a higher 30-day survival rate in the transfusion group than in the other patients (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: This observational study does not support the view that blood transfusions are associated with increased mortality rates in acutely ill patients.",

        "a": "Introduction\u00a0 Pelvic ring fractures occur frequently among the elderly population, but some studies demonstrate a bimodal distribution where the incidence is elevated among younger age groups as well. The mechanisms of injury also vary based on age groups. Previous studies are specific to trauma registries and centers, but epidemiological data within the U.S. military are sparse. In the U.S. military population, pelvic ring fractures can be related to high-energy trauma including motor vehicle accidents and combat warfare. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of pelvic ring fractures among active duty U.S. military service members between 2006 and 2015, while also describing the demographics\u00a0associated with the findings. Materials and Methods All data were collected from the U.S. Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED). To calculate the incidence rates, only first-time occurrences for pelvic ring fractures among military members were used. Each point was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), clinical modification code 808 for \"fractures of the pelvis.\" A multivariate Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate per 1,000 person-years and 95% confidence intervals while controlling for sex, race, age, rank, and service. Rate ratios were calculated using different referent factors based on differences in sex, race, age, rank, and service branch. This study was IRB exempt as all the data used were de-identified patient data from the DMED system. Results Over the 10-year study period, a total of 4,802 incident cases of pelvic ring fractures, and a total of 13,748,429 person-years were documented. The overall incidence rate of pelvic ring fractures was 0.35 per 1,000 person-years. The incidence of pelvic ring fractures was highest among the youngest age group (<20 years) and among the lower-ranking service members. Additionally, other demographic groups such as the White race, female sex, and Army service members showed the highest incidence rates. Conclusion Our study determined baseline epidemiological data on incidence rates of pelvic ring fractures in the U.S. military. Patient demographics may be contributing factors, and the present analysis was able to elucidate associated underlying demographics. We demonstrated that the incidence was highest among the younger age groups, and that incidence rates may be specific to age cohorts. This study also found that lower-ranking service members had the highest incidence in all service branches, suggesting a form of occupational risk. Furthermore, our findings suggest that females, White race groups, and Army enlisted service members show a significantly higher incidence rate and may be at a greater risk. Our findings are important as they broaden the understanding of the\u00a0patterns of pelvic ring fractures in the U.S. military population and occupational risks associated with this population.",

However, chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology (CKDu), a tubular interstitial nephropathy is typically minimally proteinuric without high rates of associated hypertension or vascular disease and it is unknown if the rates of CVD are similar. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and the risk of CVD in patients with CKDu. This cross-sectional study included patients with confirmed CKDu who were attending two renal clinics in CKDu endemic-area. A detailed medical history, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (resting and six minutes vigorous walking), echocardiograms, appropriate laboratory parameters and medical record reviews were used to collect data at baseline. The WHO/Pan American Health Organization, cardiovascular risk calculator was employed to determine the future risk of CVD. The clinics had recorded 132 number of patients with CKDu, of these 119 consented to participation in the study. The mean age was 52 (\u00b1 9.5) years and mean eGFR was 51.1 (\u00b1 27.61); a majority (81.5% (n = 97)) were males. Thirty-four patients (28.6%) had evidence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Troponin-I (p = 0.02), Age >50 years (p = 0.01) and hyperuricemia (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with IHD in CKDu. Left ventricular hypertrophy was reported in 20.2% (n = 24). According to the risk calculator, 97% of the enrolled patients were at low risk (<10%) for experiencing a cardiovascular event within the next 10 years. Patients with CKDu have low prevalence and risk for CVD, implying that a majority are likely to survive to reach end-stage kidney disease. Our findings highlight the need for developing strategies to minimize the progression of CKDu to end-stage renal disease.",

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: A surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Score of < or =8) expected to need ventilation for > or =2 days were prospectively randomized into three groups: those receiving nasopharynx and oropharynx rinsing with 20 mL of a 10% povidone-iodine aqueous solution, reconstituted in a 60-mL solution with sterile water (povidone-iodine group); those receiving nasopharynx and oropharynx rinsing with 60 mL of saline solution (saline group); or those undergoing a standard regimen without any instillation but with aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions (control group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was compared among the three groups. A total of 98 patients were analyzed (povidone-iodine group, n = 36; saline group, n = 31; and control group, n = 31). A total of 28 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed. There was a significant decrease in the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the povidone-iodine group when compared with the saline and control groups (3 of 36 patients [8%] vs. 12 of 31 patients [39%] and 13 of 31 patients [42%], respectively; p = .003 and .001, respectively). The length of stay and mortality in the surgical intensive care unit were not statistically different between the three groups.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) represents a subgroup of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that is regularly accompanied by anterior uveitis. This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of ERA-related uveitis. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Pediatric Rheumatological Database (NPRD) were used to characterize ERA-related uveitis (ERA-U). In addition to sociodemographic variables, we documented the occurrence of uveitis and course of disease, including symptoms, visual acuity, and complications, as well as JIA characteristics such as disease activity (Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 10), functional ability (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire score), laboratory variables, and treatment. RESULTS: In the years from 2002 to 2014, there were 3778 (15.2%) of a total of 24,841 JIA patients recorded in the NPRD who had ERA, and 280 (7.4%) of them had developed uveitis. Detailed ophthalmological documentation by a uveitis add-on module was available for 22.9% of these patients. Uveitis onset was acutely symptomatic in 63% of patients. Patients with uveitis were more frequently male, HLA-B27-positive, younger at ERA onset, and they had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate values at first uveitis documentation than those without uveitis. Uveitis was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.5 (\u00b1 3.9) years (50% within 2 years after ERA onset). Systemic treatment with corticosteroids and synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was associated with a (not significantly) lower risk of developing uveitis. CONCLUSION: The course of disease in ERA-U patients is frequently similar to HLA-B27-associated uveitis in adults; however, a subgroup of patients presents with asymptomatic uveitis.",

Cardioplegia versus intermittent aortic cross-clamping (IACC) are the main opponents; the following article shows that IACC can be safe, efficient and might be cheaper than cardioplegia. METHODS: Demographics and co-morbidities of 15307 CABG only patients consecutively operated on between January 1993 and October 2001 in the Heart Center in Bad Oeynhausen were assessed by the German Quality Assurance data set and risk-stratified using the EuroSCORE. Outcome (30-day or in-hospital mortality) was compared to the expected EuroSCORE estimation. RESULTS: Expected mortality was 3.25 %, observed mortality was 1.3 %, being significantly lower in the low, medium as well as high risk patients subgroup. Complication rates increased steadily with expected mortality rates. Stroke and myocardial infarction rates for patients with peripheral vessel disease were not higher than in comparable studies. More than 1000000 EUR were saved by lower cardioplegia bills.

The objective of this study was to evaluate if mucinous subtype has a relevant impact on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with adenocarcinomas of the rectum. METHODS: On the basis of the data set of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute of the United States, patients with rectal cancer between 2004 and 2011 were identified. Risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis and propensity score methods were used to assess OS and CSS. RESULTS: In total, 40,083 patients with stage I-IV rectal cancer, of whom 2483 (6.2\u00a0%) had mucinous histology, were included in this study. In unadjusted analysis, the 5-year OS and CSS for patients with a mucinous adenocarcinoma was 54.3\u00a0% [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 52.0-56.7] and 61.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 59.1-63.9) compared to 66.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 65.8-67.0) and 74.5\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 73.9-75.1) for patients with nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

        "a": "Growing evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important impact on tumorigenesis and tumor progression via a mechanism involving competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, their use in predicting the survival of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to develop a novel lncRNA expression-based risk score system to accurately predict the survival of patients with HCC. In our study, using expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) were explored in patients with HCC and normal liver tissues, and then a ceRNA network constructed. A risk score system was established between lncRNA expression of the ceRNA network and overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS); it was further analyzed for associations with the clinical features of patients with HCC. In HCC, 473 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 63 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 1417 differentially expressed mRNAs were detected. The ceRNA network comprised 41 lncRNA nodes, 12 miRNA nodes, 24 mRNA nodes, and 172 edges. The lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS was constructed based on six lncRNAs (MYLK-AS1, AL359878.1, PART1, TSPEAR-AS1, C10orf91, and LINC00501), while the risk score system for RFS was based on four lncRNAs (WARS2-IT1, AL359878.1, AL357060.1, and PART1). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed the risk score systems for OS or RFS were significant independent factors adjusted for clinical factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the area under the curve for the risk score system was 0.704 for OS, and 0.71 for RFS. Our result revealed a lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS or RFS can effectively predict the survival of patients with HCC and aid in good clinical decision-making.",

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between a novel oxidative stress index (reflecting both oxidative and anti-oxidant counterparts) with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and C-reactive protein (CRP) in coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: 100 angiographically proven CAD and 70 control subjects (mean age: 65+/-10 years, 110 males), underwent a global cardiovascular risk assessment and serum CRP and oxidative stress estimation. The Oxidative-INDEX was calculated after automated evaluation of serum hydroperoxides and total anti-oxidant capacity (D-ROM and OXY-adsorbent Test, Diacron, Italy) subtracting the OXY standardized variable from the ROM standardized variable. RESULTS: The Oxidative-INDEX was higher in CAD with respect to control subjects (p < 0.001). A stepwise elevation in the Oxidative-INDEX levels was found depending on the number of affected vessels (p < 0.001). Oxidative stress was elevated according to the presence of diabetes (p < 0.001), smoking habit (p < 0.01), and hypercholesterolemia (p < 0.05). Oxidative-INDEX significantly correlated with aging (p < or = 0.05) and CRP (p < 0.001). The Oxidative-INDEX increased with the number of cardiovascular risk factors (p < 0.001). After adjustment for traditional CV risk factors, the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the Oxidative-INDEX concentration as an independent factor for CAD (odds ratio=1.4, confidence intervals=1.1-1.9, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress represents a shared molecular pathway in atherosclerotic-related conditions, and its estimation by the automated Oxidative-INDEX could represent a valuable tool and a promising target in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CAD in the clinical setting.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF-B) in spontaneous reactivation of chronic hepatitis B (SR-CHB) has high mortality. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) improves survival by ~40% in ACLF-B but is potentially nephrotoxic. Combining telbivudine (LDT) with TDF may negate this risk and could boost rapid viral clearance and improve clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with SR-CHB were randomized to TDF (300 mg/day, n = 35) or TDF plus LDT (600 mg/day; n = 35). In all, 25 had ACLF-B and none had option for liver transplantation. Primary endpoint was survival at 3 months. Secondary endpoints were survival at 3 months in ACLF-B, serial reduction in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss and liver-related complications. RESULTS: Overall baseline clinical and laboratory parameters in the two groups were comparable. Reduction in HBV DNA at weeks 2, 4 and 12 was independent of treatment groups and presence of ACLF-B (P < 0.01). All six patients with HBsAg loss at 12 weeks had lower HBV DNA at baseline and none had ACLF-B. Patients with no ACLF-B had more rapid decline in bilirubin and alanine aminotraminase at week 2 compared with ACLF-B. Patients on TDF plus LDT showed significant improvement in AKI on follow-up (five of six patients) compared with TDF monotherapy (none of six patients) and had less reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate at week 12. Eight of 10 patients with liver-related deaths received TDF monotherapy (P = 0.02). New-onset septic shock, TDF monotherapy, e-antibody positivity, and higher baseline model for end-stage liver disease score were predictors of mortality in ACLF-B. None had treatment-related severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Addition of LDT to tenofovir is safe and may be renoprotective in spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B. Combination therapy improves survival in ACLF-B despite comparable HBV DNA suppression to tenofovir monotherapy.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a balance rehabilitation treatment by using both a powered platform on which subjects stand and specific physical exercises (EXs). DESIGN: Crossover trial. SETTING: Physical and rehabilitation medicine department in Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=33) with balance disorders (14 vestibular origin, 19 peripheral neuropathy origin). INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent powered platform then EX treatment (n=17); the other 16 received the same treatments in reverse order. powered platform consisted of balancing on a sinusoidally oscillating powered platform (in anteroposterior and laterolateral directions in separate trials) with eyes open and closed. A physical therapist administered Cawthorne-Cooksey EXs for patients with vestibular disorders and modified Frenkel EXs for patients with neuropathy. Treatment lasted 1 hour a day for 10 consecutive days, except for the weekend. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body sway area, subjective score of stability, balance and gait scores, and amplitude of head displacement while balancing on the oscillating powered platform were recorded before, (t0) after the first (t1), and after the second treatment (t2), regardless of the powered platform or EX order. RESULTS: On average, all participants improved balance regardless of the order of treatments, and more so at t2 than t1. Improvement was observed by using instrumental evaluations and balance and gait scales. In both patient groups, powered platform treatment proved to be as effective as EX in improving balance. This effect was stronger in patients with vestibular disorders, independently of order of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Balance rehabilitation with either EX or powered platform is effective in patients with balance disorders of vestibular or neuropathic origin. These findings point to the value of either or both physical EXs and powered platform in increasing stability and potentially decrease the risk of falling in patients with neuropathy, for whom few results are documented in the literature.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: In addition to its anti-ischaemic effects, the antianginal drug nicorandil is thought to have cardioprotective properties. We did a randomised trial to find out whether nicorandil could reduce the frequency of coronary events in men and women with stable angina and additional risk factors. METHODS: 5126 patients were randomly assigned 20 mg nicorandil twice daily (n=2565) or identical placebo (n=2561) in addition to standard antianginal therapy. The primary composite endpoint was coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospital admission for cardiac chest pain. The secondary endpoint was the combined outcome of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Other outcomes reported include all-cause mortality, all cardiovascular events, and acute coronary syndromes. Mean follow-up was 1.6 years (SD 0.5). Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: There were 398 (15.5%) primary endpoint events in the placebo group and 337 (13.1%) in the nicorandil group (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.97; p=0.014). The frequency of the secondary endpoint was not significantly different between the groups (134 events [5.2%] vs 107 events [4.2%]; 0.79, 0.61-1.02; p=0.068). The rate of acute coronary syndromes was 195 (7.6%) in the placebo group and 156 (6.1%) in the nicorandil group (0.79, 0.64-0.98; p=0.028), and the corresponding rates for all cardiovascular events were 436 (17.0%) and 378 (14.7%; 0.86, 0.75-0.98; p=0.027).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Pre-operative hypoalbuminemia is known to predict negative outcomes for patients undergoing major surgeries. However, various cut-off points for starting exogenous albumin have been recommended. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between pre-operative severe hypoalbuminemia, in-hospital death, and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using a database analysis was undertaken on hospitalized patients who underwent major gastrointestinal surgery. The pre-operative serum albumin level was classified into three groups: severe hypoalbuminemia (<\u00a02.0 mg/dL) and non-severe hypoalbuminemia (\u2265\u00a02.0-3.4 g/dL) and normal level (3.5-5.5 g/dL). To compare between different cut-offs, a sensitivity analysis using another albumin level classification as severe hypoalbuminemia (<\u00a02.5 mg/dL) and non-severe hypoalbuminemia (\u2265\u00a02.5-3.4 g/dL) and normal level (3.5-5.5 g/dL) was applied. The primary outcome was post-operative in-hospital death. Propensity-score adjusted regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: A total of 670 patients were included. Their average age was 57.4 \u00b1 16.3 years, and 56.1% were men. Only 59 patients (8.8%) had severe hypoalbuminemia. Overall, a total of 93 in-hospital deaths (13.9%) occurred among all included patients, but there were 24/59 (40.7%) deaths among patients with severe hypoalbuminemia, 59/302 (19.5%) deaths among patients with non-severe hypoalbuminemia, and 10/309 (3.2%) deaths among patients with normal albumin level. The adjusted odds ratio for post-operative in-hospital death comparing patients with severe hypoalbuminemia and patients with normal albumin level was 8.11 (3.31-19.87; p < 0.001), while the odds ratio for in-hospital death comparing patients with non-severe and patients with normal albumin level was 3.89 (1.87-8.10; p < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis showed similar findings, the odds ratio for in-hospital death for severe hypoalbuminemia (cut-off as <\u00a02.5 g/dL) was 7.44 (3.38-16.36; p < 0.001), while the odds ratio for in-hospital death for severe hypoalbuminemia (cut-off as 2.5-3.4 g/dL) was 3.02 (1.40-6.52; p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Severe pre-operative hypoalbuminemia in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The risk of death for patients with severe hypoalbuminemia was relatively similar when using different cut-offs such as <\u00a02.0 and <2.5 g/dL.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: The aim of this guideline is to present recommendations regarding moderately hypofractionated (240-340 cGy per fraction) and ultrahypofractionated (500 cGy or more per fraction) radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 8 key questions on appropriate indications and dose-fractionation for moderately and ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy, as well as technical issues, including normal tissue dose constraints, treatment volumes, and use of image guided and intensity modulated radiation therapy. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and Society-approved tools for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. RESULTS: Based on high-quality evidence, strong consensus was reached for offering moderate hypofractionation across risk groups to patients choosing external beam radiation therapy. The task force conditionally recommends ultrahypofractionated radiation may be offered for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer but strongly encourages treatment of intermediate-risk patients on a clinical trial or multi-institutional registry. For high-risk patients, the task force conditionally recommends against routine use of ultrahypofractionated external beam radiation therapy. With any hypofractionated approach, the task force strongly recommends image guided radiation therapy and avoidance of nonmodulated 3-dimensional conformal techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated radiation therapy provides important potential advantages in cost and convenience for patients, and these recommendations are intended to provide guidance on moderate hypofractionation and ultrahypofractionation for localized prostate cancer. The limits in the current evidentiary base-especially for ultrahypofractionation-highlight the imperative to support large-scale randomized clinical trials and underscore the importance of shared decision making between clinicians and patients.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: This study was performed for the determination of the expansion rates and outcomes and for recommendations for the surveillance of the 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). DESIGN: The study was observational with data from patients screened with ultrasound scanning for AAA at five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers for enrollment in the Aneurysm Detection and Management Trial. The eligibility requirements included: AAA from 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm in diameter and at least one repeat ultrasound scan more than 90 days after the initial screening. Patients also completed a questionnaire for demographic data and the determination of the presence of risk factors associated with AAA. The study endpoints included: 1, both mean and median expansion rates; 2, moderate expansion (>4 mm/year); 3, no expansion; 4, all causes of death; 5, AAA rupture; 6, expansion to 4 cm or more; 7, expansion to 5.0 cm or more; and 8, operative repair. RESULTS: Ultrasound scan screening results identified 1445 patients with 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs. Seven hundred ninety men met the ultrasound scan criterion of having at least two ultrasound scan studies during the study period, and these 790 men were used for this study. Mean AAA size was 3.3 cm, with an average follow-up period of 3.89 +/- 1.93 years. The median expansion rate was 0.11 cm/year. Expansion rates were significantly different (P <.001) between 3.0-cm and 3.4-cm cm AAA and 3.5-cm and 3.9-cm AAA. There were no reported AAA ruptures during the study period, although cause of death data were available in only 43% of the patients. Few 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs expanded to 5.0 cm or more during the study period. The patients with 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs who underwent operative repair during the study period were younger, had larger initial AAA diameters, and had more rapid expansion rates. CONCLUSION: AAAs of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm expanded slowly, did not rupture, and rarely had operative repair or expanded to more than 5.0 cm in our study of male patients. Expansion rates and the incidence rate of operative repair are more common in the 3.5-cm to 3.9-cm AAA when compared with the 3.0-cm to 3.4-cm AAA.",

        "a": "High-energy tibial pilon fractures continue to represent a significant challenge to the treating orthopaedic surgeon. Pre-operative evaluation includes a careful clinical assessment of the associated soft tissue injury, which frequently dictates surgical management. Staged surgical reconstruction remains the standard treatment protocol at most trauma centres. This includes application of a temporary spanning external fixator for approximately one to four\u00a0weeks, followed by open reduction and internal fixation once the surrounding soft tissues are amendable. Despite careful soft tissue management protocols, the risk of wound complications continues to be relatively high compared to other orthopaedic trauma procedures. The functional long-term outcomes of these injuries remain limited, and recent data has emphasised that the majority of patients do not regain their pre-operative work status. In addition, the health-related quality of life scores fare poorly when compared to other orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic patient populations, and many patients develop post-traumatic arthritis within the tibiotalar joint. It has been shown that the quality of fracture reduction may significantly correlate with the long-term functional outcomes. While the orthopaedic community has come a long way with regard to safe management of high-energy tibial pilon fractures, the clinical outcomes continue to remain limited. In particular, the persistently high rates of wound complications and the limited functional long-term outcomes leave significant room for improvement. Future investigators may focus on further innovations to minimise the risk of wound complications. The surgical team may emphasise the quality of fracture reduction as an important treatment goal.",

The purpose of the present study was to analyse the prognostic role of VAT derived from thoracic CT in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: The clinical database of our center was retrospectively screened for patients with acute PE between 2014 and 2017. Overall, 184 patients were included into the analysis. VAT was assessed on axial slices of the thoracic CT at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. Clinical scores, serological parameters, need for intubation, ICU admission and 30\u2009days mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Using the previously reported threshold of 100\u2009cm\u00b2 for visceral obesity definition 136 (73.9%), patients were considered as visceral obese. There was a moderate correlation between VAT and BMI (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001). There was also a moderate correlation between VAT and body height (r = 0.41, p =< 0.0001). Of all investigated clinical scores relating to acute PE, only the GENEVA score correlated weakly with VAT (r = 0.15, p = 0.04).

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze the impact of the preprocedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow on clinical outcome in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the TIMI flow 0/1 prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with a poor clinical outcome. However, it is unclear whether the same is true in patients with ongoing STEMI of less than 6\u2009hr duration, rapid reperfusion, and modern guideline-adherent therapy. METHODS: The ATLANTIC study compared prehospital versus inhospital treatment with ticagrelor in patients with acute STEMI. For this analysis, patients were divided into three groups according to the preprocedural TIMI flow grade of the infarct vessel: TIMI 0/1, TIMI 2, and TIMI 3. RESULTS: From a total of 1,680 patients, 1,113 had TIMI 0/1, 279 TIMI 2, and 288 TIMI 3 flow before primary PCI. At 30\u2009days, the composite ischemic endpoint (5.5, 2.9, and 2.1%, p\u2009<\u2009.05) and all-cause death (3.0, 1.4, and 2.1%, p\u2009=\u2009.30) were highest in patients with TIMI flow 0/1. After adjustment, preprocedural TIMI flow <3 (versus 3) was not an independent predictor of major adverse ischemic events within 30\u2009days (odds ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 0.74-4.85). However, definite stent thrombosis occurred only in patients with initial TIMI flow 0/1 (1.0%). Among these patients, those with prehospital administration of ticagrelor were less often affected (0.3% vs. 1.3%, p\u2009<\u2009.05).

We evaluated the DASH score in 827 patients with unprovoked VTE to verify prediction accuracy. A DASH score \u2264 1 had a cumulative recurrence risk at 1 year of 3.6%, as predicted by the model. The DASH score performed better in younger (< 65 years old) subjects. SUMMARY: Background The DASH prediction model has been proposed as a guide to identify patients at low risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but has never been validated in an independent cohort. Aims To validate the calibration and discrimination of the DASH prediction model, and to evaluate the DASH score in a predefined patient subgroup aged > 65 years. Methods Patients with a proximal unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) who received a full course of vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant (> 3 months) and had D-dimer measured after treatment withdrawal were eligible. The DASH score was computed on the basis of the D-dimer level after therapy withdrawal and personal characteristics at the time of the event. Recurrent VTE events were symptomatic proximal or distal DVT/PE, and were analyzed with a time-dependent analysis. Observed 12-month and 24-month recurrence rates were compared with recurrence rates predicted by the DASH model. Results We analyzed a total of 827 patients, of whom 100 (12.1%) had an objectively documented recurrence. As compared with the original DASH cohort, there was a greater proportion of subjects with a 'low-risk' (\u2264 1) DASH score (66.3% versus 51.6%, P < 0.001). The slope of the observed versus expected cumulative incidence at 2 years was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.51-1.45). The c-statistic was lower for subjects aged > 65 years (0.54) than for younger subjects (0.72). Conclusions These results confirm the validity of DASH prediction model, particularly in young subjects.

The present study sought to determine the agreement between separate heart teams on treatment decision-making based on either coronary CTA or conventional angiography. Methods and results: Separate heart teams composed of an interventional cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, and a radiologist were randomized to assess the coronary artery disease with either coronary CTA or conventional angiography in patients with de novo left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease. Each heart team, blinded for the other imaging modality, quantified the anatomical complexity using the SYNTAX score and integrated clinical information using the SYNTAX Score II to provide a treatment recommendations based on mortality prediction at 4\u2009years: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or equipoise between CABG and PCI. The primary endpoint was the agreement between heart teams on the revascularization strategy. The secondary endpoint was the impact of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CTA (FFRCT) on treatment decision and procedural planning. Overall, 223 patients were included. A treatment recommendation of CABG was made in 28% of the cases with coronary CTA and in 26% with conventional angiography. The agreement concerning treatment decision between coronary CTA and conventional angiography was high (Cohen's kappa 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.91). The heart teams agreed on the coronary segments to be revascularized in 80% of the cases. FFRCT was available for 869/1108 lesions (196/223 patients). Fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CTA changed the treatment decision in 7% of the patients. Conclusion: In patients with left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease, a heart team treatment decision-making based on coronary CTA showed high agreement with the decision derived from conventional coronary angiography suggesting the potential feasibility of a treatment decision-making and planning based solely on this non-invasive imaging modality and clinical information.

        "a": "Background. Comorbidity is an important prognostic factor for survival in different cancers; however, neither the prevalence nor the impact of comorbidity has been investigated in bone sarcoma. Methods. All adult bone sarcoma patients from western Denmark treated at the Aarhus Sarcoma Centre in the period from 1979 to 2008 were identified through a validated population-based database. Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were computed, using discharge diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry. Survival was assessed as overall and disease-specific mortality. The impact of comorbidity was examined as rates according to the level of comorbidity as well as uni- and multivariately using proportional hazard models. Results. A total of 453 patients were identified. The overall prevalence of comorbidity was 19%. The prevalence increased with age and over the study period. In patients with Ewing/osteosarcoma, comorbidity was not associated with an increased overall or disease-specific mortality. However, patients with bone sarcomas other than Ewing/osteosarcoma had increased overall mortality. Independent prognostic factors for disease-specific survival were age, tumor size, stage at diagnosis, soft tissue involvement, grade, and surgery. Conclusion. The prevalence of comorbidity in bone sarcoma patients is low. Comorbidity impaired survival in patients with non-Ewing/nonosteosarcoma, histology. This emphasizes the importance of not only treating the sarcoma but also comorbidity.",

METHODS: The authors reviewed 89 consecutive cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus for parameters associated with EVD challenge failure and permanent shunt requirement. Significant parameters were combined in a discriminant function analysis to create a failure risk index (FRI). Linear regression analysis was performed correlating the FRI with the actual rate of shunt dependency. RESULTS: Patients requiring a permanent shunt had: a larger third ventricular diameter (7.0 vs 5.4 mm; p = 0.02) and a higher Hunt and Hess grade (3 vs 2; p = 0.02) at the time of admission; and a larger third ventricular diameter (6.6 vs 5.2 mm; p = 0.04), a larger bicaudate diameter (31.9 vs 30.2 mm; p = 0.03), and higher CSF protein levels (76.5 vs 40.3 mg/dl; p < 0.0001) at the onset of EVD challenge. These patients were also more likely to be female (p = 0.01) and have a posterior circulation location of their aneurysm (p = 0.01). The FRI score was calculated based on a weighted combination of the above parameters. Linear regression analysis between FRI values and the percentage of patients who required a permanent shunt had a correlation coefficient of 91%; the risk of a permanent shunt requirement increased linearly with a rising FRI score. CONCLUSIONS: An FRI score created by discriminant function analysis can predict whether or not a permanent shunt is required, even if separate factors are not in agreement with each other or show a weak correlation when considered separately. An increased FRI score was strongly and linearly correlated with the risk of EVD challenge failure. A prospective study is necessary to validate the FRI.",

        "a": "Objective. To assess the impact of low-to-moderate risk prostate cancer on patients' quality of life (QoL) at diagnosis and within the first year of treatment. Subjects and Methods. Men (n = 672) aged 50-75 years with prostate cancer (Gleason score \u22647, PSA \u226420\u2009ng/mL and clinical staging T1c-T2b) were enrolled in five European countries. Patients completed five questionnaires, including EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate Cancer 25 (QLQ-PR25) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer 30 (QLQ-C30). Questionnaires were completed at baseline, at 3 months and 12 months after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms subscale score from baseline to the assessment at 3 months. Results. Mean (SD) age was 65.0 (5.7) years and 400 (66%) men had Gleason score \u22646 prostate cancer. The most frequently used initial treatment was radical prostatectomy (71% of patients). QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms subscale score was significantly increased at 3 months (P < 0.001), indicating that urinary symptoms worsened after treatment. The score was lower at 12 months than at 3 months, but it was still significantly higher than at baseline (P < 0.001). Hormonal treatment-related symptoms, sexual functioning, and sexual activity scores significantly worsened at 3 and 12 months (all P < 0.001). For the QLQ-C30 questionnaire, global health status/QoL score significantly decreased at month 3 but was not different from baseline by month 12. Scales for physical, role, and social functioning, and fatigue, showed significant deterioration at 3 and 12 months. Conclusions. Low-to-moderate risk prostate cancer may have a substantial effect on patients' QoL within one year following treatment.",

Data from the Predictive Health Intelligence Environment database 12 months before (baseline) and 6 months after (follow-up) the switch date (index date, March 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016) included glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hypoglycaemia, HCRU and associated costs. Baseline characteristics were balanced using propensity score matching. Change in HbA1c from baseline was similar in both matched cohorts (n = 1819 in each). Hypoglycaemia incidence and adjusted event rate were significantly lower with Gla-300. Patients switching to Gla-300 had a significantly lower incidence of HCRU related to hypoglycaemia. All-cause and diabetes-related hospitalization and emergency-department HCRU were also favourable for Gla-300. Lower HCRU translated to lower costs in patients using Gla-300. In this real-world study, switching to Gla-300 reduced the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with those switching to another BI, resulting in less HCRU and potential savings of associated costs.",

        "a": "Although radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, radiation pneumonitis is a common treatment-related toxicity. Many pulmonary function tests are not significantly altered by pulmonary toxicity of irradiation, but reductions in D(L(CO)), the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, are more commonly associated with pneumonitis. Several patient-specific factors (e.g. age, smoking history, tumor location, performance score, gender) and treatment-specific factors (e.g. chemotherapy regimen and dose) have been proposed as potential predictors of the risk of radiation pneumonitis, but these have not been consistently demonstrated across different studies. The risk of radiation pneumonitis also seems to increase as the cumulative dose of radiation to normal lung tissue increases, as measured by dose-volume histograms. However, controversy persists about which dosimetric parameter optimally predicts the risk of radiation pneumonitis, and whether the volume of lung or the dose of radiation is more important. Radiation oncologists ought to consider these dosimetric factors when designing radiation treatment plans for all patients who receive thoracic radiotherapy. Newer radiotherapy techniques and technologies may reduce the exposure of normal lung to irradiation. Several medications have also been evaluated for their ability to reduce radiation pneumonitis in animals and humans, including corticosteroids, amifostine, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, pentoxifylline, melatonin, carvedilol, and manganese superoxide dismutase-plasmid/liposome. Additional research is warranted to determine the efficacy of these medications and identify nonpharmacologic strategies to predict and prevent radiation pneumonitis.",

The aim of the present study was to carry out a direct comparison of the prognostic value of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and Body Mass Index/Weight Loss Grade (BMI/WL grade) in patients with advanced cancer. METHOD: All data were collected prospectively across 18 sites in the UK and Ireland. Patient's age, sex, ECOG-PS, mGPS and BMI/WL grade were recorded, as were details of underlying disease including metastases. Survival data were analysed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 730 patients were assessed. The majority of patients were male (53%), over 65 years of age (56%), had an ECOG-PS>0/1 (56%), mGPS\u22651 (56%), BMI\u226525 (51%), <2.5% weight loss (57%) and had metastatic disease (86%).

These recommendations are based on retrospective investigations only. In addition, BS has most often been reported as a definitive investigation with no room for equivocal cases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of BS in a large cohort of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Over a period of 1.5 years in 2008 to 2009, consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PCa were enrolled in a noninterventional, multicenter, observational study. All patients had a whole-body, planar BS. Clinical history and clinical, pathological, and biochemical data were obtained from electronic patient files and questionnaires. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Bone scintigraphy was classified into 4 categories as nonmalignant, equivocal, likely malignant, or multiple metastasis. The primary end point was final imaging, which was a composite end point of BS and additional CT and MRI investigations. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 635 eligible patients were recruited. Their median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 15 ng/mL, median Gleason was 7, and 80% of patients had local disease (T1 or T2). The proportion of nonmalignant BS was 61%, equivocal scans 26%, and likely or definitive metastasis 13%. A total of 154 patients had additional CT or MRI investigations. The final imaging diagnosis showed a prevalence of bone metastases in 87 (13.7%) of 635 patients. No bone metastases were observed in (1) patients with PSA of less than 10 ng/mL, independently of the clinical Tstage and Gleason score (n = 212) and (2) PSA of less than 20 ng/mL if Tstage is less than T3 and Gleason score is less than 8 (n = 97). Approximately 50% of the patients enrolled in this study met these criteria. CONCLUSION: This is the first prospective trial to demonstrate that BS can be avoided in patients with low-risk PCa.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven advanced prostate cancer patients receiving maximum androgen deprivation therapy were enrolled in case-control study. Baseline prostate-specific antigen, Gleason Score, bone metastase, nadir prostate-specific antigen, time to nadir prostate-specific antigen, declining slope to nadir prostate-specific antigen, estimated baseline prostate-specific antigen half-time, current prostate-specific antigen, post-nadir prostate-specific antigen time, estimated prostate-specific antigen, estimated decline of baseline prostate-specific antigen as quantitative, and ratio were recorded and calculated. RESULTS: The ratio of prostate-specific antigen progression was significantly lower at the patients who had slower declining slope to prostate-specific antigen, longer time to nadir prostate-specific antigen, and lower estimated decline ratio of baseline prostate-specific antigen (p: .016, p: .020, and p: .026, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The shorter time to nadir prostate-specific antigen following androgen deprivation therapy, faster declining slope to nadir prostate-specific antigen and higher estimated decline ratio of baseline prostate-specific antigen are associated with higher risk of disease progression in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.",

There are 30,000 inpatient admissions and between 1,000 and 5,000 deaths per year related to burns in children. Along with the elderly, children suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from thermal injuries. Achieving good clinical outcomes requires early, accurate diagnosis and aggressive treatment. Once acute burn injuries have evolved into fixed deformities they can be next to impossible to treat, leading to life-long limitations in form and function. Rehabilitation is a critical factor in achieving an acceptable functional and cosmetic outcome for both adult and pediatric burn patients. Without a rigorous and well-orchestrated rehabilitation program, the treatment of a burn is not complete. The management of burn injuries also frequently involves reconstructive surgical intervention. Acute or sub-acute reconstruction is aimed at restoring lost anatomic structures such as the eyelids and nose. In general, scars lead to surgical evaluation because of either functional loss or cosmesis. This paper discusses our experience and procedures for managing burns in the paediatric population. As a general rule, if wounds have failed to heal within 5 to 7 days, the patient should be referred to a surgeon familiar with paediatric burn injuries.",

The Quan adaptation of the CCI revised the CCI coding algorithm for applications to administrative claims data using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The purpose of the current study is to adapt and validate a coding algorithm for the CCI using the SNOMED CT standardized vocabulary, one of the most commonly used vocabularies for data collection in healthcare databases in the U.S. METHODS: The SNOMED CT coding algorithm for the CCI was adapted through the direct translation of the Quan coding algorithms followed by manual curation by clinical experts. The performance of the SNOMED CT and Quan coding algorithms were compared in the context of a retrospective cohort study of inpatient visits occurring during the calendar years of 2013 and 2018 contained in two U.S. administrative claims databases. Differences in the CCI or frequency of individual comorbid conditions were assessed using standardized mean differences (SMD). Performance in predicting one-year mortality among hospitalized patients was measured based on the c-statistic of logistic regression models. RESULTS: For each database and calendar year combination, no significant differences in the CCI or frequency of individual comorbid conditions were observed between vocabularies (SMD\u2009\u2264\u20090.10). Specifically, the difference in CCI measured using the SNOMED CT vs. Quan coding algorithms was highest in MDCD in 2013 (3.75 vs. 3.6; SMD\u2009=\u20090.03) and lowest in DOD in 2018 (3.93 vs. 3.86; SMD\u2009=\u20090.02). Similarly, as indicated by the c-statistic, there was no evidence of a difference in the performance between coding algorithms in predicting one-year mortality (SNOMED CT vs. Quan coding algorithms, range: 0.725-0.789 vs. 0.723-0.787, respectively). A total of 700 of 5,348 (13.1%) ICD code mappings were inconsistent between coding algorithms. The most common cause of discrepant codes was multiple ICD codes mapping to a SNOMED CT code (n\u2009=\u2009560) of which 213 were deemed clinically relevant thereby leading to information gain. CONCLUSION: The current study repurposed an important tool for conducting observational research to use the SNOMED CT standardized vocabulary.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a new treatment for patients with severe, refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was undertaken to assess the health status of patients with severe RA over a long-term followup period after treatment with HDC + HSCT. METHODS: Health status and utility scores were assessed in 8 patients before and after treatment with HDC + HSCT. Patients were followed up for 5 years posttransplantation. Health status was assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the RAND-36 version of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey, and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS). Utility scores were calculated using the EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the SF-36-derived utility index (called the SF-6D), from which quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived. RESULTS: Most measures of health status improved compared with baseline in the first 2 years posttransplantation, notably HAQ and AIMS scores and scores on the functional status, general health, and health change summary scales of the RAND-36 version of the SF-36. Utility scores derived from the EQ-5D questionnaire and the SF-6D also increased significantly after transplantation. This was reflected in the 0.28 QALYs gained compared with baseline. For a putative 50-year-old RA patient with a life expectancy of 20 years, a threshold analysis revealed that HDC + HSCT yielded more QALYs than conventional therapy when treatment-related mortality (TRM) was <2.8%. CONCLUSION: HDC + HSCT temporarily increased the functionality and health status of patients with severe, refractory RA. With a reported TRM of 1.3%, HDC + HSCT can be considered a realistic treatment option for patients with severe RA.",

Surrogate markers such as radiographic malalignment have been well investigated, however, patient-important outcomes are not well examined to elucidate the efficacy of TKA-PSI. The aim of this review is to determine if TKA-PSI improves patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), surgery time, blood loss, transfusion and complications (e.g. surgical site infection, deep venous thrombosis, and revision TKA). METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ongoing clinical trials. For PROMs, surgery time, blood loss, and transfusion rate, we included randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing TKA-PSI and standard TKA to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. For complications, we also included non-randomized comparative studies (non-RCT). RESULTS: This review includes 38 studies, 24 of which were RCT and 14 of which were non-RCT. These included a total of 3487 patients. The predominant population in the included studies highly reflected the general population, with 62% being female, aged over 60 and having end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. TKA-PSI did not improve PROMs as compared to standard TKA for less than 1-year (mean difference 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.92-0.97 in the Oxford knee score, mean 3-month follow-up) and for 1-year or more (mean difference 0.25, 95%CI -\u20094.39-4.89 in the WOMAC score, mean 29-month follow-up). TKA-PSI did not reduce surgery time (mean difference\u2009-\u20093.09\u2009min, 95%CI -6.73-0.55). TKA-PSI decreased blood loss with a small effect size corresponding to a 0.4\u2009g/dl hemoglobin decrease (95%CI 0.18-0.88), but did not decrease transfusion rate (risk difference\u2009-\u20090.04, 95%CI -0.09-0.01). TKA-PSI did not reduce complication rates (risk difference 0.00, 95%CI -\u20090.01-0.01 in the composite outcome). CONCLUSIONS: TKA-PSI does not improve patient-reported outcome measures, surgery time, and complication rates as compared to standard TKA. TKA-PSI decreases blood loss with a small effect, which is not enough to reduce transfusion rate.",

Patients with higher Charlson scores had higher adjusted risks of VTE (P < .001), infection (P < .001), death (P = .002), and re-revision THA (P = .011). CONCLUSION: Advanced age is a clear risk factor for VTE and mortality, but not for dislocation, infection, or re-revision. Higher Charlson index was found to be a risk factor for every complication after revision except dislocation. Greater attention is required to address the high rate of infection and re-do revision after revision THA (17.3% and 15.8%).",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: An unmet medical need exists for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed on VEGF-targeted and mTOR-inhibitor therapies. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway activation has been proposed as a mechanism of escape from VEGF-targeted therapies. Dovitinib is an oral tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGF and FGF receptors. We therefore compared dovitinib with sorafenib as third-line targeted therapies in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: In this multicentre phase 3 study, patients with clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received one previous VEGF-targeted therapy and one previous mTOR inhibitor were randomly assigned through an interactive voice and web response system to receive open-label dovitinib (500 mg orally according to a 5-days-on and 2-days-off schedule) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by risk group and region. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by masked central review. Efficacy was assessed in all patients who were randomly assigned and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01223027. FINDINGS: 284 patients were randomly assigned to the dovitinib group and 286 to the sorafenib group. Median follow-up was 11\u00b73 months (IQR 7\u00b79-14\u00b76). Median PFS was 3\u00b77 months (95% CI 3\u00b75-3\u00b79) in the dovitinib group and 3\u00b76 months (3\u00b75-3\u00b77) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio 0\u00b786, 95% CI 0\u00b772-1\u00b704; one-sided p=0\u00b7063). 280 patients in the dovitinib group and 284 in the sorafenib group received at least one dose of study drug. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included hypertriglyceridaemia (38 [14%]), fatigue (28 [10%]), hypertension (22 [8%]), and diarrhoea (20 [7%]) in the dovitinib group, and hypertension (47 [17%]), fatigue (24 [8%]), dyspnoea (21 [7%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (18 [6%]) in the sorafenib group. The most common serious adverse event was dyspnoea (16 [6%] and 15 [5%] in the dovitinib and sorafenib groups, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Dovitinib showed activity, but this was no better than that of sorafenib in patients with renal cell carcinoma who had progressed on previous VEGF-targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors. This trial provides reference outcome data for future studies of targeted inhibitors in the third-line setting. FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.",

In this analysis, we examined whether timing of the first infusion of zoledronic acid study drug after hip fracture repair influenced the antifracture efficacy and mortality benefit observed in the study. A total of 2127 patients (1065 on active treatment and 1062 on placebo; mean age, 75 yr; 76% women and 24% men) were administered zoledronic acid or placebo within 90 days after surgical repair of an osteoporotic hip fracture and annually thereafter, with a median follow-up time of 1.9 yr. Median time to first dose after the incident hip fracture surgery was approximately 6 wk. Posthoc analyses were performed by dividing the study population into 2-wk intervals (calculated from time of first infusion in relation to surgical repair) to examine effects on BMD, fracture, and mortality. Analysis by 2-wk intervals showed a significant total hip BMD response and a consistent reduction of overall clinical fractures and mortality in patients receiving the first dose 2-wk or later after surgical repair. Clinical fracture subgroups (vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip) were also reduced, albeit with more variation and 95% CIs crossing 1 at most time points. We concluded that administration of zoledronic acid to patients suffering a low-trauma hip fracture 2 wk or later after surgical repair increases hip BMD, induces significant reductions in the risk of subsequent clinical vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures, and reduces mortality.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: To assess periprocedural results and secondary endovascular procedure outcomes over 5 years in patients aged \u226580 vs <80 years undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global post-market registry (ENGAGE) were used for the analyses. A total of 1263 consecutive patients were enrolled in the prospective, observational, single-arm registry and divided into 2 groups according to age: \u226580 years (290, 22.9%) and <80 years (973, 77.1%). Baseline patient characteristics, risk scores according to the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) reporting standards, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, quality of life assessments [EuroQol 5 (EQ5D) index], and treatment outcomes, including all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, major adverse events, secondary endovascular procedures, and endoleaks were compared between groups. RESULTS: Octogenarians were classified into the highest category of the SVS risk stratification system; however, this did not result in a significant difference in the 30-day mortality [1.4% (4/290) vs 1.2% (12/973) for controls; p=0.85] or major adverse event rates [5.2% (15/290) vs 3.6% (35/973), p=0.23]. Multivariable analysis confirmed that age \u226580 years, pulmonary disease, large aneurysm diameter, and renal insufficiency were significantly associated with all-cause mortality, whereas diameter was the only parameter associated with increased aneurysm-related mortality. The differences in freedom from secondary endovascular procedures over 5 years between octogenarians and controls did not reach statistical significance (88.5% vs 83.2%, p=0.07). CONCLUSION: EVAR can be performed in individuals aged \u226580 years with no statistically significant difference in midterm aneurysm-related deaths compared with younger patients. The findings in this elderly patient cohort show that EVAR can be safely performed with acceptable morbidity rates in octogenarians.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and NT-pro-BNP can predict an increased risk of cardiovascular events and ischemic stroke. The limited reliability to predict the risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) justifies the objective of our study to determine the role of NT-pro-BNP in patients with TIAs. METHODS: From our prospective stroke registry, we performed a retrospective study in all patients with the diagnosis of TIA admitted to the Stroke Unit of our Hospital between January 2008 and March 2018. NT-pro-BNP was determined in the first hours after TIA. The endpoint was the development of stroke during the follow-up. RESULTS: 381 patients were included. Mean time of follow-up was 36.8 (\u00b116.4) months. 224 patients were hospitalized due to a stroke during the follow-up, and 157 were not. NT-pro-BNP serum levels were higher in patients who suffered a stroke compared to those who did not (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.001). We also found greater levels of this marker the earlier the stroke happened (p\u202f=\u202f0.024). A cut-off point of 800\u202fpg/mL of NT-pro-BNP predicted a stroke with a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 79% (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.001), and was independently associated with higher risk of stroke after a TIA (OR: 6.65, p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.001). This association persisted for different etiopathogenic TIA groups (cardioembolic: OR 26.12, p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.001; undetermined: OR 4.87, p\u202f=\u202f0.006; atherothrombotic: OR 1.67, p\u202f=\u202f0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The early determination of NT-pro-BNP is a simple and very useful alternative to predict the prognosis after TIA regardless of the etiopathogenesis of the TIA.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock occur commonly in severe burns. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is also common and often results as a consequence of sepsis. Mortality is unacceptably high in burn patients who develop AKI requiring renal replacement therapy and is presumed to be even higher when combined with septic shock. We hypothesized that high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) as a blood purification technique would be beneficial in this population. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of HVHF on the hemodynamic profile of burn patients with septic shock and AKI involving seven burn centers in the United States. Subjects randomized to the HVHF were prescribed a dose of 70\u00a0ml/kg/hour for 48\u00a0hours while control subjects were managed in standard fashion in accordance with local practices. RESULTS: During a 4-year period, a total of nine subjects were enrolled for the intervention during the ramp-in phase and 28 subjects were randomized, 14 each into the control and HVHF arms respectively. The study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Ramp-in subjects were included along with those randomized in the final analysis. Our primary endpoint, the vasopressor dependency index, decreased significantly at 48\u00a0hours compared to baseline in the HVHF group (p\u2009=\u20090.007) while it remained no different in the control arm. At 14\u00a0days, the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score decreased significantly in the HVHF group when compared to the day of treatment initiation (p\u2009=\u20090.02). No changes in inflammatory markers were detected during the 48-hour intervention period. No significant difference in survival was detected. No differences in adverse events were noted between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: HVHF was effective in reversing shock and improving organ function in burn patients with septic shock and AKI, and appears safe. Whether reversal of shock in these patients can improve survival is yet to be determined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01213914 . Registered 30 September 2010.",

        "a": "Growing studies have implicated the association of ubiquitination-related genes (UbRGs) with the cancer progression and the long-term survival of patients. However, the prognostic values of UbRGs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have not been investigated. Our study aimed to establish a ubiquitination-related model for prognosis prediction and internal mechanism investigation. The transcriptome expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between LUAD specimens and nontumor specimens. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate assays were carried out on DEGs to preliminarily screen survival-related UbRGs. Then, the LASSO Cox regression model was applied to develop a multigene signature, which was then demonstrated in two GEO datasets by the use of Kaplan-Meier, ROC, and Cox analyses. We estimated the immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment via CIBERSORT and immunotherapy response through the TIDE algorithm. In this study, a total of 71 ubiquitination-related DEGs were identified. Nine UbRGs, including TUBA4A, TRIM2, PLK1, ARRB1, TRIM58, PLK1, ARRB1, CCNB1, TRIM6, PTTG1, and CCT2, were included to establish a risk model, which was validated in TCGA and GEO datasets. The multivariate assays demonstrated that the 9-UbRGs signature was a robust independent prognostic factor in the overall survival of LUAD patients. The abundance of CD8 T cells, activated CD4 T memory cells, resting NK cells and macrophages was higher in the high-risk group, and the TMB of high-risk group was statistically higher than the low-risk group. Multiple drugs approved by FAD, targeting UbRGs, were available for the treatment of LUAD. Overall, we identified a nine ubiquitination-related gene signature, and the signature may be applied to be a potential biomarker for CD8 T cells response and clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors for LUAD.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), malnutrition may develop as renal function declines and the abdominal organs become enlarged. We investigated the relationship of intra-abdominal mass with nutritional status. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary hospital outpatient clinic. Anthropometric and laboratory data including serum creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol were collected, and kidney and liver volumes were measured. Total kidney and liver volume was defined as the sum of the kidney and liver volumes and adjusted by height (htTKLV). Nutritional status was evaluated by using modified subjective global assessment (SGA). RESULTS: In a total of 288 patients (47.9% female), the mean age was 48.3\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2\u00a0years and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 65.3\u2009\u00b1\u200925.3\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2. Of these patients, 21 (7.3%) were mildly to moderately malnourished (SGA score of 4 and 5) and 63 (21.7%) were at risk of malnutrition (SGA score of 6). Overall, patients with or at risk of malnutrition were older, had a lower body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, and poorer renal function compared to the well-nourished group. However, statistically significant differences in these parameters were not observed in female patients, except for eGFR. In contrast, a higher htTKLV correlated with a lower SGA score, even in subjects with an eGFR\u2009\u226545\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2. Subjects with an htTKLV\u2009\u22652340\u00a0mL/m showed an 8.7-fold higher risk of malnutrition, after adjusting for age, hemoglobin, and eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional risk was detected in 30% of ambulatory ADPKD patients with relatively good renal function. Intra-abdominal organomegaly was related to nutritional status independently from renal function deterioration.",

We previously retrospectively identified predictors of severity in patients with acute lower intestinal bleeding. The aim of this study was to prospectively validate a clinical prediction rule for severe acute lower intestinal bleeding. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients admitted to an academic, tertiary care or a community-based teaching hospital for management of acute lower intestinal bleeding. Data were collected on seven previously identified predictors of severe bleeding: heart rate > or = 100/min, systolic blood pressure < or = 115 mmHg, syncope, nontender abdominal exam, rectal bleeding in the first 4 h of evaluation, aspirin use, and >2 comorbid conditions. Severe bleeding was defined as transfusion of > or =2 units of red blood cells, and/or a decrease in hematocrit of > or =20% in the first 24 h, and/or recurrent rectal bleeding after 24 h of stability (accompanied by a further decrease in hematocrit of > or =20%, and/or additional blood transfusions, and/or readmission for acute lower intestinal bleeding within 1 wk of discharge). Patients were stratified into 3 risk groups according to the previously developed prediction rule: low (no risk factors), moderate (1-3 risk factors), and high (>3 risk factors). RESULTS: A total of 275 patients with acute lower intestinal bleeding were identified. The risk of severe bleeding in each risk category was similar in the validation and derivation cohorts (p values >0.05): low risk 6%versus 9%, moderate risk 43%versus 43%, and high risk 79%versus 84%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.754 for the validation cohort and 0.761 for the derivation cohort. The magnitude of the risk score was significantly correlated with major clinical outcomes including surgery, death, blood transfusions, and length of stay. CONCLUSION: We have developed and prospectively validated a clinical prediction rule for acute severe lower intestinal bleeding. This prediction rule could improve the triage of patients to appropriate levels of care and interventions, and guide a more standardized approach to acute lower intestinal bleeding.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To detail the distribution of causes of death from localized prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The database PCBase Sweden links the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register with other nationwide population-based healthcare registers. We selected all 57 187 men diagnosed with localized PCa between 1997 and 2009 and their 114 374 PCa-free control subjects, matched according to age and county of residence. Mortality was calculated using competing risk regression analyses, taking into account PCa risk category, age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: In men with low-risk PCa, all-cause mortality was lower compared with that in corresponding PCa-free men: 10-year all-cause mortality was 18% for men diagnosed at age 70 years, with a CCI score of 0, and 21% among corresponding control subjects. Of these cases, 31% died from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with 37% of the corresponding control subjects. For men with low-risk PCa, 10-year PCa-mortality was 0.4, 1 and 3% when diagnosed at age 50, 60 and 70 years, respectively. PCa was the third most common cause of death (18%), after CVD (31%) and other cancers (30%). By contrast, PCa was the most common cause of death in men with intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa. CONCLUSIONS: Men with low-risk PCa had lower all-cause mortality than PCa-free men because of lower CVD mortality, driven by early detection selection; however, for men with intermediate- or high-risk disease, the rate of PCa death was substantial, irrespective of CCI score, and this was even more pronounced for those diagnosed at age 50 or 60 years.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Current therapies are effective in preventing SHEs in 50-80% of patients with IAH and SHEs, leaving a substantial number of patients at risk. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a standardized human pancreatic islet product in subjects in whom IAH and SHEs persisted despite medical treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm, phase 3 study of the investigational product purified human pancreatic islets (PHPI) was conducted at eight centers in North America. Forty-eight adults with T1D for >5 years, absent stimulated C-peptide, and documented IAH and SHEs despite expert care were enrolled. Each received immunosuppression and one or more transplants of PHPI, manufactured on-site under good manufacturing practice conditions using a common batch record and standardized lot release criteria and test methods. The primary end point was the achievement of HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at day 365 and freedom from SHEs from day 28 to day 365 after the first transplant. RESULTS: The primary end point was successfully met by 87.5% of subjects at 1 year and by 71% at 2 years. The median HbA1c level was 5.6% (38 mmol/mol) at both 1 and 2 years. Hypoglycemia awareness was restored, with highly significant improvements in Clarke and HYPO scores (P > 0.0001). No study-related deaths or disabilities occurred. Five of the enrollees (10.4%) experienced bleeds requiring transfusions (corresponding to 5 of 75 procedures), and two enrollees (4.1%) had infections attributed to immunosuppression. Glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly on immunosuppression, and donor-specific antibodies developed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Transplanted PHPI provided glycemic control, restoration of hypoglycemia awareness, and protection from SHEs in subjects with intractable IAH and SHEs. Safety events occurred related to the infusion procedure and immunosuppression, including bleeding and decreased renal function. Islet transplantation should be considered for patients with T1D and IAH in whom other, less invasive current treatments have been ineffective in preventing SHEs.",

The Caduet in Untreated Subjects Population (CUSP) trial was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy/safety of the combination of a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besylate) and a statin (atorvastatin calcium) in a single-pill form (5/20 mg) plus therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) compared with placebo plus TLC in patients with comorbid hypertension and dyslipidemia without evidence of cardiovascular disease. At week 4, additional antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication was permitted. The primary end point was the proportion of patients in whom the dual goal of blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control (<100 mg/dL) was met at week 4. This dual goal attainment was significantly greater with amlodipine/atorvastatin plus TLC compared with placebo plus TLC at week 4 (47.6% vs 1.7%; P<.001), with further improvements at week 8. Most adverse events were mild to moderate. Therapy with single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin plus TLC in these patients significantly increased dual blood pressure/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment compared with placebo plus TLC.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) still remains a serious health problem and is called a \"silent epidemic\". Each year in Europe 262 per 100,000 individuals suffer from TBI. The most common consequence of severe head injuries include acute subdural (SDH) and epidural hematomas (EDH), which usually require immediate surgically treatment. The aim of our study is to identify factors which have the strongest prognostic value in relation to in-hospital mortality rate among of patients undergoing surgery for EDH and SDH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohort included 128 patients with isolated craniocerebral injuries who underwent surgery for EDH (28 patients) and SDH (100 patients) in a single, tertiary care Department of Neurosurgery. The data were collected on admission of patients to the Emergency Department and retrospectively analyzed. The following factors were analyzed: demographic data, physiological parameters, laboratory variables, computed tomography scan characteristics and the time between trauma and surgery. Likewise, we have investigated the in-hospital mortality of patients at the time of discharge. RESULTS: We found that the factors with the strongest prognostic values were: the initial GCS score, respiratory rate, glycaemia, blood saturation, systolic blood pressure, midline shift and type of hematoma. Additionally, we proved that a drop by one point in the GCS score almost doubles the risk of in-hospital death while the presence of coagulopathy increases the risk of in-hospital death almost six times. CONCLUSION: Most of the factors with the strongest prognostic value are factors that the emergency team can treat prior to the hospital admission. Coagulopathy, however that has the strongest influence on in-hospital death rate can only be efficiently treated in a hospital setting.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of optimized guideline adherence in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. METHODS: An individual-based decision tree model was developed using the SMART risk score tool which estimates the 10-year risk for recurrent vascular events in patients with manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD). Analyses were based on the EUROASPIRE IV survey. Outcomes were expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Data from 4663 patients from 13 European countries were included in the analyses. The mean estimated 10-year risk for a recurrent vascular event decreased from 20.13% to 18.61% after optimized guideline adherence. Overall, an ICER of 52,968\u20ac/QALY was calculated. The ICER lowered to 29,093\u20ac/QALY when only considering high-risk patients (\u226520%) with decreasing ICERs in higher risk patients. Also, a dose-response relationship was seen with lower ICERs in older patients and in those patients with higher risk reductions. A less stringent LDL target (<2.5\u202fmmol/L vs. <1.8\u202fmmol/L) lowered the ICER to 32,591\u20ac/QALY and intensifying cholesterol treatment in high-risk patients (\u226520%) instead of high-cholesterol patients lowered the ICER to 28,064\u20ac/QALY. An alternative method, applying risk reductions to the CVD events instead of applying risk reductions to the risk factors lowered the ICER to 31,509\u20ac/QALY. CONCLUSION: Depending on the method used better or worse ICERs were found. In addition, optimized guidelines adherence is more cost-effective in higher risk patients, in patients with higher risk reductions and when using a less strict LDL-C target. Current analyses advice to maximize guidelines adherence in particular patient subgroups.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common, and the frequency of patients taking oral anticoagulants is increasing. However the optimal initial triage, management, and long term care plans of hemorrhagic TBI patients taking oral anticoagulants is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the usage pattern of reversal agents for hemorrhagic TBI patients taking oral anticoagulants, and examine their characteristics and outcomes as compared to hemorrhagic TBI patients not taking these medications. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Included were adults with trauma categorization and traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) between April 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Patient age, type of ICH, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, oral anticoagulant prescribed pre-injury, anticoagulation reversal agent given, and hospital discharge disposition were recorded. RESULTS: For the entire sample size (n=111), the mean age and GCS were 71.6 years old and 13.8, respectively. Compared to patients not taking oral anticoagulants, patients taking oral anticoagulants were older (76.7 years old versus 69.1; p<0.01), had similar GCS scores (13.7 versus 13.9; p=0.69), had fewer subarachnoid hemorrhages (18.9% versus 37.8%; p=0.04), were less likely to discharge home (48.6% versus 73.0%; p=0.01), and had similar incidence of mortality (13.5% versus 6.7%; p=0.30). A total of 14/37 (37.8%) patients taking oral anticoagulants received reversal agents in the emergency department. Compared to patients taking oral anticoagulants and not given reversal agents, patients taking oral anticoagulants and given reversal agents had similar ages (78.8 years old versus 75.4; p=0.41), had similar GCS scores (12.9 versus 14.1; p=0.17), had similar ICH types (all p=1.0), were less likely to discharge home (48.6% versus 73.0%; p=0.01), and had higher incidence of mortality (28.6% versus 4.2%; p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This limited data set did not show improved outcomes by giving reversal agents to hemorrhagic TBI patients taking oral anticoagulants. However, until more robust data is available, judicious use of reversal agents in this high-risk patient population should remain common practice.",

Here, we examined the prognostic value of a combination of the red cell distribution width (RDW) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), namely, the RDW-CEA score (RCS), in stage I LUAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with 154 patients with stage I LUAD was conducted. Patients were divided into RCS 1 (decreased RDW and CEA), RCS 2 (decreased RDW and increased CEA, increased RDW and decreased CEA), and RCS 3 (increased RDW and CEA) subgroups based on the best optimal cutoff points of RDW and CEA for overall survival (OS). The differences in other clinicopathological parameters among RCS subgroups were calculated. Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS among these groups were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and risk factors for outcome were calculated by a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Seventy, 65, and 19 patients were assigned to the RCS 1, 2, and 3 subgroups, respectively. Patients\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years (P\u2009<\u20090.001), male sex (P\u2009=\u20090.004), T2 stage (P\u2009=\u20090.004), and IB stage (P\u2009=\u20090.006) were more significant in the RCS 2 or 3 subgroups. The RCS had a good area under the curve (AUC) for predicting DFS (AUC\u2009=\u20090.81, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and OS (AUC\u2009=\u20090.93, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. METHODS: [(99m)Tc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female, and 60% were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95% CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95% CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. CONCLUSION: Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of longitudinal studies with adequate sample size and follow-up period which have objectively assessed social outcomes among those with mild or moderate musculoskeletal injury or that are not limited to hospital inpatients. We aimed to address this gap by prospectively assessing the potential predictors of return to pre-injury work and daily activities. METHODS: Persons with mild/moderate musculoskeletal injuries from a vehicle-related crash were surveyed within the first 3 months after the crash (baseline; n=364), and at 12 (n=284) and 24 months (n=252). Participants self-reported return to work, and whether it was return to full or modified duties at work. Analyses were restricted to 170 participants who reported being in pre-injury paid work and had provided information at either 12 months only or at both 12 and 24 months. Return to usual activities was assessed using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scale 'Usual Activities' dimension. RESULTS: Twenty-four months after injury 82% (n=121) had returned to work. After multivariable adjustment, not being admitted to hospital was associated with 44% higher likelihood of returning to work at 24 months. Not having any pre-injury chronic illness was associated with returning to work after 24 months, multivariable-adjusted risk ratio (RR), 1.21 (95% confidence intervals, CI: 1.02-1.45). Each 1-SD increase in Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 Mental Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) score at baseline was associated with returning to work at 24 months RR 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02-1.25). Younger age, higher SF-12 physical component summary (PCS), and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were mutually independent predictors of returning to usual activities 24 months later. CONCLUSION: A range of bio-psychosocial factors, particularly quality of life measures, independently predicted social outcomes including return to work and return to usual daily activities. These determinants could be measured early in the recovery process and be potentially amenable to intervention.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study parcitipants were HIV-infected patients in a Korean HIV/AIDS cohort enrolled from 19 hospitals between 2006 and 2017. Data collected at entry to the cohort were analyzed. The 5-year CVD risk in each participant was calculated using three CVD risk equations: reduced CVD prediction model of HIV-specific data collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs (R-DAD), Framingham general CVD risk score (FRS), and Korean Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score (KRS). RESULTS: CVD events were observed in 11 of 586 HIV-infected patients during a 5-year (median) follow-up period. The incidence of CVD was 4.11 per 1,000 person-years. Older age (64 vs. 41 years, P = 0.005) and diabetes mellitus (45.5% vs. 6.4%, P <0.001) were more frequent in patients with CVD. Using R-DAD, FRS, and KRS, 1.9%, 2.4%, and 0.7% of patients, respectively, were considered to have a very high risk (\u226510%) of 5-year CVD. The discriminatory capacities of the three prediction models were good, with c-statistic values of 0.829 (P <0.001) for R-DAD, 0.824 (P <0.001) for FRS, and 0.850 (P = 0.001) for KRS. CONCLUSION: The FRS, R-DAD, and KRS performed well in the Korean HIV/AIDS cohort.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: High hemoglobin (HGB) concentration is frequently seen in Tibetans in clinical practice; however, the impact on postsurgical prognosis in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is not precisely known. Thus, we sought to understand the association between high HGB level and postoperative outcome in Tibetans with poor-grade aSAH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Results of clipping in consecutive Tibetan patients with poor-grade aSAH were analyzed retrospectively for the period January 2012 to January 2017. Based on the upper limit (160g/L) of normal hemoglobin levels, patients were divided to a high (HHC) and a normal (NHC) HGB-level cohort according to the first routine blood result on admission. Propensity score matching was used for baseline matching in the 2 cohorts. Postoperative complications in the 2 groups were compared. Prognosis after ictus, including 6-month neurological functional status and mortality at 30 days and 6 months were also assessed. RESULTS: Risk of ischemia, pulmonary embolism and lower-limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was higher in HHC than NHC (62.88% vs. 21.64%; P<0.001; 10.30% vs. 1.31%, P<0.005; 24.74% vs. 7.21%, P<0.001, respectively). Hospital stay also differed significantly (15.82\u00b13.86 vs. 10.37\u00b14.80 days; P<0.001). Out of the 194 patients, 150 survived at 6 months. At 6-month neurological functional follow-up, 8 NHC patients had favorable modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores \u22642 at discharge, versus only 1 HHC patient, showing better outcome in NHC than HHC (8.25% vs. 1.03%; P=0.035). In-hospital mortality was significantly greater in HHC than NHC (17.52% vs. 7.22%; P=0.029). 30-day post-ictus mortality was 30.93% in HHC versus 14.43% in NHC (P<0.006). There was also a significant difference in mortality at 6 months post-ictus (47.42% vs. 18.56%; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: High HGB level was associated with increased risk of postsurgical cerebral ischemia, pulmonary embolism and lower-limb DVT and poor prognosis in poor-grade aSAH patients. Preoperative hemodilution therapy might be beneficial in reducing operative complications, reducing hospital stay and improving short-term prognosis for neurological functional recovery in aSAH patients with high HGB concentration, but further detailed research is needed.",

        "a": "CONTEXT: Genetic variability and perceived stress have been identified as likely predictors of psychoneuroimmune (PNI) symptoms in patients with cancer. In the clinical setting, the ability to identify the patients at greatest risk of development of severe PNI symptoms continues to be elusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of cytokine genes and perceived stress scores as clinical predictors of PNI symptom severity in patients with a new diagnosis of advanced cancer compared with cancer-free controls (CFCs). DESIGN: Patients with advanced-stage cancer beginning chemotherapy and CFCs completed questionnaires at 6 time points during 24 weeks and provided blood samples for genotyping. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokine genotypes and perceived stress scores with PNI symptom severity were evaluated using bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Forty-two participants were recruited (21 patients with cancer and 21 CFCs). Patients with cancer and CFCs were demographically similar and had similar allele frequencies for 15 of 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Cancer-affected patients reported higher perceived stress and PNI symptom severity. Associations were found between several single-nucleotide polymorphisms and PNI symptoms, but no clear pattern emerged across time. Perceived stress was associated with PNI symptom severity for memory problems and fatigue at all 6 time points. CONCLUSION: Perceived stress performed better than cytokine genotypes as a clinical predictor of PNI symptoms in this small-scale study. Assessing perceived stress is an easy and low-cost approach that can be used to identify patients at high risk of PNI symptom development.",

Objective: To evaluate whether an ultrasmall, molecularly targeted core-shell silica nanoparticle (Cornell prime dots) can safely and reliably identify optically avid SLNs in head and neck melanoma during fluorescence-guided biopsy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nonrandomized clinical trial enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed melanoma in whom SLN mapping was indicated. Exclusion criteria included known pregnancy, breast-feeding, or medical illness unrelated to the tumor. The trial was conducted between February 2015 and March 2018 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, with postoperative follow-up of 2 years. Data analysis was conducted from February 2015 to March 2018. Interventions: Patients received standard-of-care technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid followed by a microdose administration of integrin-targeting, dye-encapsulated nanoparticles, surface modified with polyethylene glycol chains and cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-tyrosine peptides (cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles) intradermally. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end points were safety, procedural feasibility, lowest particle dose and volume for maximizing nodal fluorescence signal, and proportion of nodes identified by technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid that were optically visualized by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles. Secondary end points included proportion of patients in whom the surgical approach or extent of dissection was altered because of nodal visualization. Results: Of 24 consecutive patients enrolled (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [51-71] years), 18 (75%) were men. In 24 surgical procedures, 40 SLNs were excised. Preoperative localization of SLNs with technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid was followed by particle dose-escalation studies, yielding optimized doses and volumes of 2 nmol and 0.4 mL, respectively, and maximum SLN signal-to-background ratios of 40. No adverse events were observed. The concordance rate of evaluable SLNs by technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid and cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles was 90% (95% CI, 74%-98%), 5 of which were metastatic. Ultrabright nanoparticle fluorescence enabled high-sensitivity SLN visualization (including difficult-to-access anatomic sites), deep tissue imaging, and, in some instances, detection through intact skin, thereby facilitating intraoperative identification without extensive dissection of adjacent normal tissue or nerves. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that nanoparticle-based fluorescence-guided SLN biopsy in head and neck melanoma was feasible and safe.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of health care professionals competent in diabetes management worldwide. Digital education is increasingly used in educating health professionals on diabetes. Digital diabetes self-management education for patients has been shown to improve patients' knowledge and outcomes. However, the effectiveness of digital education on diabetes management for health care professionals is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and economic impact of digital education in improving health care professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, and competencies. We also assessed its impact on patient outcomes and health care professionals' behavior. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of digitalized diabetes management education for health care professionals pre- and postregistration. Publications from 1990 to 2017 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by 2 authors. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of digital education modality, comparators, outcome measures, and intervention duration. Most studies comparing digital or blended education to traditional education reported significantly higher knowledge and skills scores in the intervention group. There was little or no between-group difference in patient outcomes or economic impact. Most studies were judged at a high or unclear risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Digital education seems to be more effective than traditional education in improving diabetes management-related knowledge and skills. The paucity and low quality of the available evidence call for urgent and well-designed studies focusing on important outcomes such as health care professionals' behavior, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness as well as its impact in diverse settings, including developing countries.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: There is little evidence to demonstrate the impact of heparin bridging (HB) in major surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of HB in lung cancer surgery by comparing HB and non-HB (NHB) groups. METHODS: We extracted patients who were taking an anticoagulant, were diagnosed with lung cancer, and underwent lung resection between April 2014 and March 2018 from a nationwide database in Japan. We compared the HB and NHB groups to determine the benefits and risks of HB. The proportion of postoperative thromboembolism and bleeding events between the HB and NHB groups was the primary outcome. We performed propensity score matching to remove any HB assignment bias. RESULTS: We selected 2416 patients, and among these, 1068 patients had HB and 1348 did not. Propensity score matching extracted 1500 patients: 750 with HB and 750 without HB. After matching, a Chi-square test showed no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative thromboembolism (1.5% vs 0.9%, p value\u2009=\u20090.343) and bleeding events (5.9% vs 4.0%, p value\u2009=\u20090.124) between the two groups.

        "a": "PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to determine the long-term functional outcomes of pin tract infection after percutaneous pinning of displaced supracondylar humeral fractures in children, and to evaluate the potential for intracapsular pin placement based on pin configuration in cadaveric elbows. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients requiring percutaneous pinning in a single institution over a 19-year period. The functional outcome assessment consisted of a telephone interview using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)] Outcome Measure and the Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation (PREE) questionnaires. The risk of intracapsular pin placement was studied in cadaveric elbows for the three most common pin configurations: divergent lateral, parallel lateral, and medial and lateral crossed pins. RESULTS: Of 490 children, 21 (4.3\u00a0%) developed pin tract infection. There were 15 (3.1\u00a0%) superficial and six (1.2\u00a0%) deep infections (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). Both DASH and PREE scores were excellent at a mean of 18\u00a0years post-surgery. The risk of intracapsular pin placement using parallel lateral pins was found to be greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than either crossed or divergent lateral pinning configurations. CONCLUSIONS: Most infections after pinning of supracondylar humerus fractures are superficial and can be managed with pin removal, oral antibiotics, and local wound care. Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis are rare complications; when they do occur, they seem to be associated with parallel lateral pin configuration, though a causal relationship could not be established from the current study. Satisfactory long-term outcomes of these deep infections can be expected when treated aggressively with surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics.",

        "a": "AIM: The goal of this study is to clarify the association between perceived stress in work and the types of coping strategies used by Portuguese nurses. BACKGROUND: The healthcare work environment as a source of overwork and stress has been implicated in today's nursing shortage. Staff nurses play a pivotal role in creating work environments, but little is known about the nature of Portuguese nurses' work. DESIGN: A descriptive correlational design and a cross-sectional approach were used for this study. METHOD: A total of 102 registered nurses, in three Portuguese hospitals, were selected. The Perceived Stress Scale and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire were used to measure job stress and coping strategies, respectively. RESULTS: High levels of stress were reported by 52\u00b72% of respondents. The results showed that the main stressful factors for nurses are patient death and dying (32\u00b78%), followed by emergency situations (22\u00b78%) and low supportive relationships (18\u00b70%). The most frequently used coping strategy was self-controlling, followed by planful problem-solving and seeking social support. Pearson's correlation tests indicated that the total score of the Perceived Stress Scale significantly negatively correlated with the subscales of the use of coping strategies of seeking social support, self-controlling, planful problem-solving, distancing and escape-avoidance, indicating that those who were more distressed showed lower levels in mentioned coping subscales. CONCLUSION: Stress in nursing can be best reduced through the application of the control cycle approach and risk assessment/risk management techniques. Stress management of nurses may improve their productivity and quality of life. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A change in leadership styles from the managerial level and reallocation of personnel may help reduce job stress. It is important for clinical practitioners to understand theoretical research concerning human stress responses, appraisal and coping to apply knowledge in practice when dealing with a client who has experienced a crisis.",

        "a": "Despite its involvement in various immune functions, including the allogeneic activation of T-lymphocytes, the relevance of calcium (Ca2+) for GVHD pathobiology is largely unknown. To elucidate a potential association between Ca2+and GVHD, we analyzed Ca2+-sensing G-protein coupled receptor 6a (GPRC6a) signaling in preclinical GVHD models and conducted a prospective EBMT study on Ca2+ serum levels prior alloSCT including 363 matched sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantations (alloSCTs). In experimental models, we found decreased Gprc6a expression during intestinal GVHD. GPRC6a deficient alloSCT recipients had higher clinical and histopathological GVHD scores leading to increased mortality. As possible underlying mechanism, we found increased antigen presentation potential in GPRC6a-/- alloSCT recipients demonstrated by higher proliferation rates of T-lymphocytes. In patients with low Ca2+ serum levels (\u2264median 2.2 mmol/l) before alloSCT, we found a higher incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV (HR = 2.3 Cl = 1.45-3.85 p = 0.0006), severe acute GVHD grades III-IV (HR = 3.3 CI = 1.59-7.14, p = 0.002) and extensive chronic GVHD (HR = 2.0 Cl = 1.04-3.85 p = 0.04). In conclusion, experimental and clinical data suggest an association of reduced Ca2+ signaling with increased severity of GVHD. Future areas of interest include the in depth analysis of involved molecular pathways and the investigation of Ca2+ signaling as a therapeutic target during GVHD.",

Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) is not uncommon, particular in patients who receive invasive operation, which may have negative impact on prognosis. In this study, we aim to investigate the characteristics and short-term outcome of nosocomial BSI in patients with ACLF. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with ACLF and nosocomial BSI from January 2014 to December 2015 were retrospectively studied. Clinical characteristics and distribution of bacteria at the time of BSI onset and short-term mortality were collected. RESULTS: The most common etiology of ACLF was hepatitis B virus infection. Eighty-one percent of ACLF patients had other types of infections at BSI onset. Gram-negative bacteria (77.8%) were the main pathogens, among which Escherichia coli was responsible for 46.9%. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main Gram-positive bacteria. The most prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria was extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 42.9%. Multivariate analysis found that model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and number of organ failures were predictors of 28-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic of the numbers of organ failures to predict 28-day mortality was higher than MELD score (0.833 vs. 0.784, 0.4099), but without significant difference. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were the most prevalent pathogens and ESBL-producing bacteria were responsible for most of the MDR bacteria in patients with ACLF and nosocomial BSI.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Robotic prostatectomy requires pneumoperitoneum and a steep Trendelenburg position; however, this condition may compromise cerebral blood flow. Here, we evaluated the effect of pneumoperitoneum and the steep Trendelenburg position on internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow measured by Doppler ultrasound during robotic prostatectomy. METHODS: Patients who underwent robotic prostatectomy were prospectively recruited. The ICA blood flow was measured at the following five time-points: with the patient awake and in the supine position (Ta), 10\u2009min after anaesthetic induction in the supine position (T1), 10 (T2) and 30 (T3) min after pneumoperitoneum in the steep Trendelenburg position, and at the end of surgery in the supine position after desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum (T4). Hemodynamic and cerebrovascular variables were measured at each time-point. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were evaluated. The ICA blood flows were significantly lower at T2 and T3 than at T1 (162.3\u2009\u00b1\u200944.7 [T2] vs. 188.0\u2009\u00b1\u200949.6\u2009ml/min [T1]; p\u2009=\u2009.002, 163.1\u2009\u00b1\u200939.9 [T3] vs. 188.0\u2009\u00b1\u200949.6\u2009ml/min [T1]; p\u2009=\u2009.009). The ICA blood flow also differed significantly between Ta and T1 (236.8\u2009\u00b1\u200958.3 vs. 188.0\u2009\u00b1\u200949.6\u2009ml/min; p\u2009<\u2009.001). Heart rates, cardiac indexes, peak systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity were significantly lower at T2 and T3 than at T1. However, ICA diameter, mean blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure did not differ significantly at all time-points. CONCLUSION: Pneumoperitoneum and the steep Trendelenburg position caused decreased ICA blood flow, suggesting that they should be carefully performed during robotic prostatectomy, especially in patients at risk of postoperative cerebrovascular accident.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: There is a rise in incidence of esophageal carcinoma due to increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma. Probably the only curative option to date is the use of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. Traditional open esophageal resection is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Furthermore, this approach involves long intensive care unit stay, in-hospital stay and long recovery period. Minimally invasive esophagectomy could reduce the morbidity and accelerate the post-operative recovery. METHODS/DESIGN: Comparison between traditional open and minimally invasive esophagectomy in a multi-center, randomized trial. Patients with a resectable intrathoracic esophageal carcinoma, including the gastro-esophageal junction tumors (Siewert I) are eligible for inclusion. Prior thoracic surgery and cervical esophageal carcinoma are indications for exclusion. The surgical technique involves a right thoracotomy with lung blockade and laparotomy either with a cervical or thoracic anastomosis for the traditional group. The minimally invasive procedure involves a right thoracoscopy in prone position with a single lumen tube and laparoscopy either with a cervical or thoracic anastomosis. All patients in both groups will undergo identical pre-operative and post-operative protocol. Primary endpoint of this study are post-operative respiratory complications within the first two post-operative weeks confirmed by clinical, radiological and sputum culture data. Secondary endpoints are the operative data, the post-operative data and oncological data such as quality of the specimen and survival. Operative data include duration of the operation, blood loss and conversion to open procedure. Post-operative data include morbidity (major and minor), quality of life tests and hospital stay.Based on current literature and the experience of all participating centers, an incidence of pulmonary complications for 57% in the traditional arm and 29% in the minimally invasive arm, it is estimated that per arm 48 patients are needed. This is based on a two-sided significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Knowing that approximately 20% of the patients will be excluded, we will randomize 60 patients per arm. DISCUSSION: The TIME-trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized study to define the role of minimally invasive esophageal resection in patients with resectable intrathoracic and junction esophageal cancer.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To show how segmentation can enhance risk stratification tools for integrated care, by providing insight into different care usage patterns within the high-risk population. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. A risk score was calculated for each person using a logistic regression, which was then used to select the top 5% high-risk individuals. This population was segmented based on the usage of different care settings using a k-means cluster analysis. Data from 2008 to 2011 were used to create the risk score and segments, while 2012 data were used to understand the predictive abilities of the models. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from administrative data sets covering primary and secondary care for a random sample of 300\u2005000 English patients. MAIN MEASURES: The high-risk population was segmented based on their usage of 4 different care settings: emergency acute care, elective acute care, outpatient care and GP care. RESULTS: While the risk strata predicted care usage at a high level, within the high-risk population, usage varied significantly. 4 different groups of high-risk patients could be identified. These 4 segments had distinct usage patterns across care settings, reflecting different levels and types of care needs. The 2008-2011 usage patterns of the 4 segments were consistent with the 2012 patterns. DISCUSSION: Cluster analyses revealed that the high-risk population is not homogeneous, as there exist 4 groups of patients with different needs across the care continuum. Since the patterns were predictive of future care use, they can be used to develop integrated care programmes tailored to these different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Usage-based segmentation augments risk stratification by identifying patient groups with different care needs, around which integrated care programmes can be designed.",

BACKGROUND: The PCE predict 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD events, and the MESA Risk Score predicts risk of CHD. Their comparative performance for the prediction of fatal events is poorly understood. METHODS: We evaluated 53,487 patients ages 45 to 79 years from the CAC Consortium, a retrospective cohort study of asymptomatic individuals referred for clinical CAC scoring. Risk discrimination was measured using C-statistics. RESULTS: Mean age was 57 years, 35% were women, and 39% had CAC of 0. There were 421 CHD and 775 CVD deaths over a mean 12-year follow-up. In the overall study population, discrimination with the MESA Risk Score with CAC and the PCE was almost identical for both outcomes (C-statistics: 0.80 and 0.79 for CHD death, 0.77 and 0.78 for CVD death, respectively). Addition of CAC to the PCE improved risk discrimination, yielding the largest C-statistics. The MESA Risk Score with CAC and the PCE plus CAC showed the best discrimination among the 45% of patients with 5% to 20% estimated risk. Secondary analyses by estimated CVD risk strata showed modestly improved risk discrimination with CAC also among low- and high-estimated risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the current guideline recommendation to use, among available risk scores, the PCE for initial risk assessment and to use CAC for further risk assessment in a broad borderline and intermediate risk group. Also, in select individuals at low or high estimated risk, CAC modestly improved discrimination. Studies in unselected populations will lead to further understanding of the potential value of tools combining risk scores and CAC for optimal risk assessment.",

We evaluated the association of pre-existing psychiatric disorders with subsequent healthcare utilization and mortality in patients discharged from ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied adult patients admitted to 14 medical-surgical ICUs (January 2014-June 2016) with ICU length stay \u226524\u00a0h who survived to hospital discharge. Pre-existing psychiatric disorders were identified using algorithms for diagnostic codes captured \u22645\u00a0years before ICU admission. Outcomes were healthcare utilization (emergency department visit, hospital or ICU readmission) and mortality. We used logistic regression models with propensity scores to estimate associations, converted to risk ratios (RR). RESULTS: We included 10,598 patients. 37.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a03982) had a psychiatric history. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders were at higher risk of subsequent emergency department visits (RR 1.49, 95%CI 1.29-1.71), hospital readmission (RR 1.49, 95%CI 1.34-1.66), ICU readmission (RR 2.64, 95%CI 1.55-4.49) one-year post-ICU discharge, compared to patients without pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders had a higher risk of mortality (RR 1.31, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) six-months post-ICU discharge.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Although dysphagia is a common complication after anterior cervical decompression and fusion, important risk factors have not been rigorously evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of dysphagia on neurological and quality-of-life outcomes is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for dysphagia, and the impact of this complication on short and long-term clinical outcomes, in patients treated with anterior cervical decompression and fusion. METHODS: Four hundred and seventy patients undergoing a 1-stage anterior or 2-stage anteroposterior cervical decompression and fusion were enrolled in the prospective AOSpine CSM (Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy) North America or International study at 26 global sites. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine important clinical and surgical predictors of perioperative dysphagia. Preoperatively and at each follow-up visit, patients were evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA), Nurick score, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of covariance was used to evaluate differences in outcomes at 6 and 24 months between patients with and those without dysphagia, while controlling for relevant baseline characteristics and surgical factors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of dysphagia was 6.2%. Bivariate analysis showed the major risk factors for perioperative dysphagia to be a higher comorbidity score, older age, a cardiovascular or endocrine disorder, a lower SF-36 Physical Component Summary score, 2-stage surgery, and a greater number of decompressed levels. Multivariable analysis showed patients to be at an increased risk of perioperative dysphagia if they had an endocrine disorder, a greater number of decompressed segments, or 2-stage surgery. Both short and long-term improvements in functional, disability, and quality-of-life scores were comparable between patients with and those without dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: The most important predictors of dysphagia are an endocrine disorder, a greater number of decompressed levels, and 2-stage surgery. At the time of both short and long-term follow-up, patients with perioperative dysphagia exhibited improvements in functional, disability, and quality-of life scores that were similar to those of patients without dysphagia.

METHODS: \u2003Fifty-five patients who underwent PLIF/PLF for lumbar spondylosis using the new technique between January 2011 and January 2016 were included. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores for low back pain and visual analog scale scores. Screw loosening was evaluated via the presence of a translucent zone surrounding the pedicle screw using plain X-radiography (Xp). The screw trajectory was evaluated by measuring the rostral range (RR) and the lateral range score (LRS). The RR is the angle between the line drawn along the distal end plate of the vertebra and the line drawn along the screw on the lateral view. The LRS is the score given depending on the position of the tip of the screw seen on the Xp taken in the anteroposterior (AP) view. The pedicle ring is equally divided into the medial third (zone A), central third (zone B), and the lateral third (zone C) by four vertical lines. A score of 0 to 3 points is given depending on the position of the tip of the screw: 0, outside the pedicle ring; 1, zone A; 2, zone B; and 3, zone C. RESULTS: \u2003Bone fusion was recorded in 49 patients (49/55 patients). The total number of screws with a visible translucent zone on Xp was 26 (26/242 screws). When the screws are inserted at a more acute angle in the lateral view (low RR) or when the screws are directed more medially (low LRS), the risk of developing a translucent zone around the pedicle screw increased. CONCLUSION: \u2003With CBT, the pedicle screws are inserted from the pars interarticularis that is rich in cortical bone, strong enough to withstand the substantial forces usually encountered in the region. Our clinical data suggest that the optimal screw trajectory is one where the screw is inserted at an angle\u2009>\u200922.55 degrees (high RR) on the lateral view Xp and where the tip of the screw is directed toward the lateral third of the pedicle on the AP Xp. We believe the naturally occurring buttress effect that exists in the vertebra may give CBT a mechanical and anatomical advantage over the traditional screw trajectory.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase1 (AOX1), and molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) are enzymes involved in purine metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XDH, AOX1, and MOCOS genes in relation to clinical parameters and risk of drug side effects in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients treated with azathioprine (AZA) as a part of standard immunosuppressive regimen. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six patients receiving AZA for the first year from the surgery were genotyped for the presence of common SNPs in the coding regions of XDH, AOX1, and MOCOS genes using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: AOX1 rs55754655 variant allele carriers received a higher mean AZA dose 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation (P < 0.05). The patients inheriting rs594445 MOCOS minor allele required significantly lower doses of AZA for efficient treatment compared with wild-type heterozygotes at 3, 6, and 12 months from the transplantation (mean values: 1.39 versus 1.59, 1.38 versus 1.58, and 1.33 versus 1.53 mg\u00b7kg\u00b724 h) and displayed lower mean RBC count at the time points evaluated. Multivariate analysis has shown that the effect of MOCOS rs594445 polymorphism is independent of other investigated gene variations and might influence AZA dosage, similarly to TPMT heterozygosity. The authors have not observed an association between any of the studied XDH SNPs and clinical parameters of AZA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study should be regarded as preliminary. However, if the observed association between SNPs: AOX1 rs55754655, MOCOS rs594445, and AZA dose requirements would be positively confirmed in further independent studies, it could be introduced into clinical practice to individualize thiopurine treatment.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Postbariatric anastomotic or staple line leakage (ASLL) is a dreaded complication with an incidence up to 1.6% and a leak-associated mortality of 5.0% to 16.7%. Feared low sensitivity of abdominal computed tomography (CT) for detecting ASLL is causing surgeons to omit CT and directly perform a diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with suspected ASLL. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic value of CT in case of suspected ASLL after bariatric procedures and to identify reliable CT characteristics predicting the presence of ASLL. SETTING: A large teaching hospital and bariatric center of excellence. METHODS: All CT scans performed for suspected ASLL after bariatric surgery in the period November 2007 until August 2016 were independently reevaluated by abdominal radiologists. The diagnostic value of CT by means of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value was analyzed comparing results of reevaluation to a standard of reference. Multivariable regression was performed to identify reliable CT characteristics for the presence of ASLL. RESULTS: A total of 66 CT scans were performed because of suspected leakage. Reevaluation of CT scans revealed a sensitivity of 89% to 100%, a specificity of 69% to 78%, a positive predictive value of 39% to 50%, and a negative predictive value of 97% to 100% of CT for detecting ASLL after bariatric surgery. Multivariable logistic regression of ASLL characteristics on CT revealed 'air near the anastomosis/staple line' as the only independent predictor for the presence of ASLL. CONCLUSION: With a sensitivity of 89% to 100% and negative predictive value of 97% to 100%, a negative CT can rule out ASLL in patients with a lower suspicion of ASLL.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the application of a nursing crisis management system in the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. METHODS: A retrospective nursing method was implemented. A total of 280 cases of patients were diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia in the isolation ward of our hospital. The 280 cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia were divided into two groups: the nursing crisis management system group (n=150, the nursing crisis management was given) and the non-nursing crisis management system (n=130, routine nursing management was given). The psychological status (profile of mood states (POMS) score) of nursing staff before and after the implementation of the nursing crisis management, the psychological status of patients after the implementation of nursing crisis management (POMS score), emotion, cognition, behavior severity, patients' satisfaction with nursing, treatment compliance (Morisky Medication Compliance Scale (MMAS) score) of patients, the rate of cure of patients and the infection rate of nursing staff were compared. RESULTS: Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the POMS scores of patients and nurses in the nursing crisis management system group decreased (all P<0.05). Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the emotional, cognitive and behavioral scores of patients in the nursing crisis management system group were lower, while the MMAS score, satisfaction with nursing and cure rate were significantly increased (all P<0.05). The 142 nursing staff did not catch coronavirus. CONCLUSION: During the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak and the current normal epidemic prevention and control periods, our crisis management mode was introduced into nursing work. The construction of the nursing crisis management mode under the epidemic situation can improve the psychological state and improve the management efficiency of the patients and nurses. The patients' satisfaction is high and the treatment compliance is good.",

        "a": "In the last decade, the applicability of robotic surgery has been demonstrated in many interventions, expanding the indications of minimally invasive surgery also to pediatrics. The aim of the study is to evaluate postoperative pain to demonstrate better control following robotic procedures compared to thoraco-laparoscopic surgery. An observational, retrospective, multicentre study was performed involving 204 children undergoing robot-assisted surgery and thoraco/laparoscopic surgery at the Istituto Giannina Gaslini in Genoa and the Siena University Hospital (2013-2017): 83 children underwent robotic-assisted surgery and 121 thoracic-laparoscopic surgery. Personal data and type of intervention were assessed, dividing the patients into four categories: thoracic, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and urological surgeries. We analyzed the anesthetic risk according to ASA classification by type of intervention, the type of anesthesia used, the anesthetic drugs used during surgery and in the postoperative period. Both the problems that occurred during the procedures and the number of interventions converted into open during robotic surgery and laparoscopic thoracic surgery were analyzed. Pain was measured on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day (FLACC or NRS scales). By comparing the two groups (robotics-non-robotics), the analysis shows that postoperative pain does not change with the chosen approach, but always maintains very low values, typical of minimally invasive surgery. The pain score is significantly higher in patients undergoing thoracic surgery, either robotic or thoracoscopic, compared to those undergoing gastrointestinal surgery (P corrected according to Bonferroni: 0.0006) and those undergoing urological intervention (P corrected according to Bonferroni: 0.04). In conclusion, no significant change in the intensity of postoperative pain between the two groups was found, while it is seen that the pain in patients undergoing thoracic interventions (robotic/thoracoscopic) is more intense than that reported for other types of interventions.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for leg wound healing complications after great saphenous vein harvest. Leg healing complications occur in 1-25% of coronary artery bypass graft patients, and are often underestimated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 230 patients enrolled in a prospective trial to evaluate a minimally invasive approach compared with conventional longitudinal harvest were reviewed. Of 100 patients with diabetes, 49 had undergone minimally invasive harvest (group A). Forty-nine patients from the pool without diabetes who underwent minimally invasive harvest were selected using propensity scoring analysis (group B), and 46 diabetic patients operated using a conventional technique (group C) were matched to group A patients. Ninety-five patients with and 49 without diabetes finally entered the study. The quality of leg wound healing was quantified by ASEPSIS score by two independent surgeons in a blinded manner. The occurrence of complications was compared between groups. RESULTS: Fewer leg wound healing complications occurred in diabetic patients in the minimally invasive compared with the conventional group (P < 0.0001). Rates of complications were comparable among diabetic and non-diabetic patients operated using the minimally invasive technique. The intraoperative flow of vein grafts obtained by the minimally invasive technique was comparable to that of veins harvested using the conventional technique. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that postoperative leg wound morbidity can be significantly attenuated by the adoption of a less invasive approach, even in high-risk patients with diabetes. The advantages are not offset by the co-existence of other cardiovascular risk factors or by a long history of diabetes.",

Isoprostanes are established markers of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of urinary 8-isoprostane levels with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by a validated scoring system. METHOD: Urinary 8-isoprostane levels were measured in 100 consecutive patients scheduled for coronary angiography. Extent and severity of CAD were assessed by modified Gensini scores. RESULTS: In patients with CAD, 8-isoprostane levels were higher (P < 0.001) than in patients without CAD (68.75 +/- 5.5 vs. 38.27 +/- 3.7 pg/ml). The levels of 8-isoprostane correlated with the number of risk factors (P < 0.001) and significantly increased in relation with the number of diseased vessels (P < 0.001). A significant (P < 0.001) correlation was found between 8-isoprostane levels and Gensini scores (r = 0.496), and a stepwise elevation in 8-isoprostane levels was observed across the increasing tertiles of the Gensini scores (P < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 8-isoprostane was an independent predictor (odds ratio: 7.19 and P = 0.007) associated with angiographic CAD. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the role of oxidative stress in the atherosclerotic process. Urinary 8-isoprostane levels reflect the extent and severity of CAD and they may provide additional information for risk assessment in patients with suspected CAD.",

METHODS: A computer adaptive test for suicide risk was built using the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and tested among the emergency department population. Data were analyzed from a sample of 1,350 patients in several Massachusetts emergency departments. The test was built as outlined by the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. RESULTS: Of 1,350 patients, 74 (5%) scored above the cutoff of BSS\u00a0>\u00a02. Item 2, \"Wish to die\", was the most informative item. When using only Item 2, 20% (n\u00a0=\u00a015/74) of at-risk patients and 3% (n\u00a0=\u00a040/1,276) of not-at-risk patients were misclassified. Patients were classified after four items with computer adaptive testing trait estimates highly comparable to those of the full scale. The precision rule model did not reduce the scale.

We evaluated changes in clinical and bacterial characteristics, and their associations with clinical outcomes with SAB in this population over a 21-year period. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 453 hospitalized, non-neutropenic adults receiving maintenance HD who developed monomicrobial SAB between 1995 and\u00a02015. EXPOSURE: Clinical characteristics and bacterial genotype. OUTCOME: All-cause and SAB-attributable mortality, persistent bacteremia, and metastatic complications. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Proportions of participants experiencing each outcome were calculated overall and by calendar year. Secular trends were estimated using binomial risk regression, a generalized linear model with the log link function for a binomial outcome. Associations with outcomes were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Over the 21-year study period, patients receiving maintenance HD experienced significant increases in age- and diabetes-adjusted SAB-attributable mortality (0.45% [95% CI, 0.36%-0.46%] per year), persistent bacteremia (0.86% [95% CI, 0.14%-1.55%] per year), metastatic complications (0.84% [95% CI, 0.11%-1.56%] per year), and infection with the virulent Saureus clone USA300 (1.47% [95% CI, 0.33%-2.52%] per year). Over time, the suspected source of SAB was less likely to be a central venous catheter (-1.32% [95% CI,\u00a0-2.05 to-0.56%] per year) or arteriovenous graft (-1.08% [95% CI,\u00a0-1.54 to-0.56] per year), and more likely to be a nonvascular access source (1.89% [95% CI, 1.29%-2.43%] per year). Patients with a nonvascular access suspected source of infection were more likely to die as a result of their S aureus infection (OR, 3.20 [95% CI, 1.36-7.55]). The increase in USA300 infections may have contributed to the observed increase in persistent bacteremia (OR, 2.96 [95% CI, 1.12-7.83]) but did not explain the observed increases in SAB-attributable mortality (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.19-3.61]) or metastatic complications (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.53-3.41]). LIMITATIONS: Single-center, inpatient cohort.

METHODS: A total of 184 consecutive patients \u226550 years old with moderate and severe TBI admitted to a level 1\u00a0trauma center were included. Neuroworsening was assessed clinically by using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and radiologically by using the Rotterdam CT score on repeated time points. Functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended 6\u00a0months after injury. RESULTS: The platelet inhibitor group (mean age, 77.3\u00a0years; n\u00a0= 43) and the warfarin group (mean age, 73.2\u00a0years; n\u00a0= 20) were significantly older than the nonuser group (mean age, 63.7 years; n\u00a0= 121; P \u2264 0.001). In the platelet inhibitor group 74% and in the warfarin group, 85% were injured by falls. Platelet inhibitors were not significantly associated with clinical or radiologic neuroworsening (P\u00a0= 0.37-1.00), whereas warfarin increased the frequency of worsening in GCS score (P\u00a0= 0.001-0.028) and Rotterdam CT score (P\u00a0= 0.004).

Platelet inhibitors did not predict mortality or worse outcome after adjustment for age, preinjury disability, GCS score, and Rotterdam CT score, whereas warfarin predicted both mortality and worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with moderate and severe TBI, preinjury platelet inhibitors did not cause neuroworsening or predict higher mortality or worse outcome. In contrast, preinjury warfarin caused neuroworsening and was an independent risk factor for mortality and worse outcome at 6 months.

We aimed to characterize the subgroup of patients, who had to be emergently intubated, to identify predictors of the need for intubation and assess their outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the single-center study KEEP SIMPLEST, which evaluated a new in-house SOP for EVT under primary procedural sedation. We used descriptive statistics and regression models to examine predictors and functional outcome of emergently intubated patients. RESULTS: Twenty of 160 (12.5%) patients were emergently intubated. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, premorbid modified Rankin scale (mRS), Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, age and side of occlusion were not associated with need for emergency intubation. Emergency intubation was associated with a lower rate of successful reperfusion (OR, 0.174; 95%-CI, 0.045 to 0.663; p\u2009=\u20090.01). Emergently intubated patients had higher in-house mortality (30% vs 6.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.001) and a lower rate of mRS 0-2 at 3 months was observed in those patients (10.5% vs 37%, p\u2009=\u20090.024). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency intubation during a primary procedural sedation regimen for EVT was associated with lower rate of successful reperfusion. Less favorable outcome was observed in the subgroup of emergently intubated patients. More research is required to find practical predictors of intubation need and to determine, whether emergency intubation is safe under strict primary procedural sedation regimens for EVT.",

We proposed that admission BD would correlate with outcomes after trauma in a pediatric population. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of all patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit in an adult trauma center with pediatric commitment in whom an admission BD was available, over the 5-year period ending June 2001. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients formed the study population. Overall mortality was 20%. Patients who died were younger (6 +/- 5 vs. 9 +/- 5 years; p = 0.009), had lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission (7 +/- 5 vs. 10 +/- 5; p < 0.0001), had higher Injury Severity Scores (24 +/- 14 vs. 14 +/- 9; p < 0.0001), and had lower Pediatric Trauma Scores (7 +/- 4 vs. 10 +/- 2; p < 0.0001). No patient with a BD less negative than -5 died, whereas 13 of 37 patients with a BD of -5 or higher died (37%) (p < 0.0001). Of the 13 patients who died, 8 never cleared their BD and died within 33 +/- 18 hours of admission. Failure to clear BD was associated with 100% mortality. Five patients who normalized their BD died of isolated closed head injuries (time to death, 37 +/- 18 hours; p = not significant). All surviving patients normalized their BD within 43 +/- 41 hours of admission. Seventy-five percent of patients who survived (39 of 52) had a normal BD within 48 hours of admission.

        "a": "Diet has been shown to have an effect on both inflammation and oesophageal cancer. This study investigated the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII\u00ae) and the risk of oesophageal cancer in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. A case-control study was conducted during 2008-2009 in Urumqi and Shihezi. DII scores were calculated based on dietary intake assessed by a validated FFQ administered to 359 incident oesophageal cancer patients and 380 hospital-based controls. Higher DII scores indicate more pro-inflammatory diets. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between DII scores and oesophageal cancer risk. Oesophageal cancer patients had a significantly higher median DII score (-0\u00b735; interquartile range (IQR)=-2\u00b725, 1\u00b786) than that of controls (-1\u00b741; IQR -3\u00b707, 0\u00b740). Multivariable logistic analysis revealed a positive association between higher DII scores and oesophageal cancer risk (ORQuartile 4 v. 1 2\u00b755; 95 % CI 1\u00b761, 4\u00b706; P trend<0\u00b7001). A pro-inflammatory diet appears to be associated with an increased risk of oesophageal cancer in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Specific carcinogenic mechanisms are discussed. Accumulating evidence, to which the study contributes, indicates that encouraging the intake of more anti-inflammatory foods may be a strategy to protect against oesophageal cancer in this high-risk area of China.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate experience of the use of temsirolimus for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in a single center in Japan. METHODS: This study included 55 consecutive patients with mRCC who received temsirolimus in a routine clinical setting, and retrospectively reviewed the comprehensive outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients, 20 had a Karnofsky performance status of \u226480, and 5, 41 and 9 were classified into favorable, intermediate and poor risk groups, respectively, according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center model. Initially, 25 mg of temsirolimus was applied weekly; however, dose modification was required in 19 patients, resulting in a relative dose intensity of 90.5 % throughout this series. As the best responses to temsirolimus, 4, 44 and 7 were judged to have a partial response, stable disease and progressive disease, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of these patients following the introduction of temsirolimus was 7.0 and 25.0 months, respectively. Of several factors examined, only the pretreatment C-reactive protein level was shown to be independently associated with both PFS and OS. The common adverse events related to temsirolimus corresponding to \u2265grade 3 were anemia in 4, thrombocytopenia in 3, stomatitis in 3 and hyperglycemia in 3. Quality of life analysis using 36-Item Short Form showed that there were no significant differences in any scale scores between surveys performed before and 3 months after the introduction of temsirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus was well tolerated and facilitated comparatively favorable cancer control in Japanese patients with mRCC.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to pilot a brief (6-week) group curriculum for providing mindfulness training to obese individuals, called Mindful Eating and Living (MEAL). SETTING AND DESIGN: Participants were recruited through a local Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in spring 2006. Data was collected at three time points: baseline, completion of intervention (6 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (12 weeks). INTERVENTION: Six weekly two-hour group classes (with two monthly follow-up classes). Content included training in mindfulness meditation, mindful eating, and group discussion, with emphasis on awareness of body sensations, emotions, and triggers to overeat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key variables assessed included changes in weight, body-mass index (BMI), eating behavior, and psychological distress. In addition, physiological markers of cardiovascular risk were evaluated including C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). RESULTS: Ten obese patients enrolled with a mean BMI of 36.9 kg/m\u00b2 [SD\u00b16.2]. The mean weight was 101 kg/m\u00b2 and the mean age was 44 years (SD=8.7; range=31-62). Compared to baseline data, participants showed statistically significant increases in measures of mindfulness and cognitive restraint around eating, and statistically significant decreases in weight, eating disinhibition, binge eating, depression, perceived stress, physical symptoms, negative affect, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that a eating focused mindfulness-based intervention can result in significant changes in weight, eating behavior, and psychological distress in obese individuals.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Sacubitril-valsartan is a combination drug that contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved sacubitril-valsartan for treatment of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms following a large, Phase III clinical trial (PARADIGM-HF) that demonstrated a 20% reduction in the combined primary end-point of death from cardiovascular cause or hospitalization for heart failure compared to enalapril. Areas covered: This review discusses the clinical efficacy and safety of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Expert opinion: Based on the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril-valsartan offers compelling reductions in meaningful clinical endpoints, independent of age or severity of disease. The rate of adverse events was comparable between the enalapril and sacubitril-valsartan groups, although the absolute rates are likely underestimated due to the entry criteria and run-in period. Future trials and post-market surveillance are critical to better understand the risk of angioedema in high risk populations, particularly African-Americans, as well as long-term theoretical risks including the potential for increased cerebral amyloid plaque deposition with possible development of neurocognitive disease.

Patients with suspected or confirmed HCM may be encountered throughout the healthcare system, especially in internal medicine and cardiology. Thus,\u00a0thorough knowledge of HCM is essential among healthcare providers. Methods A web-based questionnaire was developed to assess the cross-sectional evaluation of HCM knowledge. It covered aspects such as epidemiology and diagnosis, treatment, lifestyle, risk stratification of sudden cardiac death, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator knowledge. Results In total, 123 subjects completed the survey. The mean age was 38.5 \u00b110.7 years and two-thirds (n=82) were females; 43.1% were physicians (non-specialist 24.4%, cardiologists 8.9%, specialist, other than cardiology 9.8%); and the remaining were nurses (nurses within cardiology 37.4%, nurses outside cardiology 19.5%). Almost all subjects had heard about the disease (95.9%) and the vast majority (77.2%) had taken part in the management of a patient with HCM. The total mean score was 15.9 \u00b13.9 credits and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were 14, 15, and 18 credits, respectively. The predefined arbitrary pass score of \u226560% was reached by 61.8%, and 20.3% were considered to pass with distinction. Physicians scored higher than nurses (70.7 \u00b117.0% vs 58.1 \u00b111.8; p<0.001). Within each professional category, there was a similar score with regard to gender. Conclusions There is a considerable lack of knowledge of HCM among healthcare professionals working within the field of internal medicine/cardiology. This insufficient knowledge may contribute to less implementation of evidence-based medicine and current guidelines, although further studies are needed to confirm this.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The comparative safety profile of SARS-Cov2 vaccines requires further characterization in real-world settings. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the VigilVacCOVID study was to assess the short-term safety of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 during the vaccination campaign of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and solid-organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) at a hospital clinic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center, post-authorization study to characterize short-term adverse reactions (ARs) after vaccination. The primary endpoint was to assess between-vaccine differences (HCPs receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) and between-population differences (HCPs and SOTRs, both receiving mRNA-1273) in the risk of any ARs. Propensity score and covariate-adjusted multivariate models were used. The key secondary endpoint was to provide a descriptive assessment of the frequencies and intensity distribution of ARs. RESULTS: We included 5088 HCPs and 1289 patients. mRNA-1273 showed greater reactogenicity than BNT162b2, with an odds ratio (OR) for any AR of 3.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.48-3.73; p value: <\u00a00.001) and a higher frequency and intensity of reported ARs. Compared with HCPs vaccinated with mRNA-1273, SOTRs showed a lower risk of ARs (OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.25-0.50), with fewer and less severe ARs. Age, sex, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were statistically significant covariates for the risk of any AR. A history of drug allergy was significant in the comparison between vaccines (BNT162b2 vs. mRNA-1273), but not in that between SOTRs and HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mRNA-1273 had greater reactogenicity than BNT162b2. Overall, both vaccines had an adequate tolerability profile. mRNA-1273 vaccination caused fewer ARs with milder severity in SOTRs.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To discover the effects of the lowest hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass on end-organ function and mortality in patients who did not receive red blood cell transfusion and to identify predictors of nadir hematocrit. METHODS: From November 1, 2004, to October 1, 2009, 7957 patients underwent cardiac surgery supported by cardiopulmonary bypass and were not transfused. The relationship between nadir hematocrit and morbidity, markers of end-organ function, and survival was studied using generalized propensity score analysis. Factors associated with nadir hematocrit were identified by linear regression. RESULTS: Median nadir hematocrit was 30% (25th to 75th percentile, 27%-33%). Lower nadir hematocrit was associated with higher maximum intraoperative lactic acid (intrasubject correlation, -0.44). After risk adjustment, nadir hematocrit was associated with worse renal function (lower estimated glomerular filtration rate; P = .012), more myocardial injury (higher troponin level; P = .004), longer postoperative ventilator support (P < .001), longer hospital stay (P < .001), and higher mortality (P = .042). Female gender, older age, lower body mass index, higher New York Heart Association class, and combined valve procedure and coronary artery bypass were associated with lower nadir hematocrit; however, the strongest correlate was preoperative hematocrit (correlation coefficient, 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Although red blood cell transfusion has associated morbidity risk, there must be a tradeoff between adverse effects of low hematocrit during cardiac surgery and those of transfusion. The strong association of nadir hematocrit with preoperative hematocrit suggests the need for investigation and optimization before elective cardiac surgery.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma generally has an indolent nature, but cases demonstrating certain features are progressive. UICC TNM classification is the most widely adopted system to evaluate the biological behavior of this carcinoma, but it is doubtful whether this system that evaluates only the preoperative findings can appropriately reflect patient prognosis. In this study, we established a new staging system (iStage) based on not only preoperative but also intraoperative findings. METHODS: We investigated the prognoses of 5,911 patients with papillary carcinoma without distant metastasis at diagnosis who underwent initial surgery between January 1987 and January 2005 and compared the utility of iStage with that of conventional classification systems, such as UICC Stage, MACIS score (>7 and \u22647), AMES, and CIH classification. RESULTS: Disease-free survival (DFS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) of patients with stage IVA were better than those of high-risk patients on other systems, and CSS of stage III patients did not differ from stage IVA patients. We established iStage by improving the original UICC stage. We set cutoff age to 55\u00a0years, instead of 45. Patients showing significant, not minimal, extrathyroid extension on intraoperative findings underwent T upgrading: tumor size 2\u00a0cm or smaller to T3 and larger than 2\u00a0cm to T4a. N classification was revised based on the size of node metastasis and extranodal tumor extension: N0, no preoperatively detected regional node metastasis; N1, preoperatively detected regional node metastasis measuring 3\u00a0cm or less and without extranodal tumor extension on intraoperative findings; N2, regional node metastasis >3\u00a0cm or having extranodal tumor extension on intraoperative examination. Five-year and 10-year DFS and CSS of iStage IVA patients were worse than high-risk patients on other classification systems, and iStage III patients showed a worse DFS, but not CSS, than iStage I or II patients. CONCLUSIONS: We established a new classification system, iStage, based not only on preoperative but also on intraoperative findings, which has high utility. Appropriate intraoperative evaluation is mandatory to grade biological characteristics, including prognosis, of papillary carcinoma.",

Methods: A clinical data of 45 cases with PJI after THA (16 cases) and TKA (29 cases) that were treated with debridement with prosthesis retention between January 2011 and January 2015 were collected and analyzed. There were 19 males and 26 females with a mean age of 58.4 years (range, 23-78 years). PJI occurred after primary joint arthroplasty in 40 cases and after revision in 5 cases. The mean time interval between the performance of infection symptoms and the arthroplasty or revision was 15.5 months (range, 0.5-72.0 months). The time interval between the performance of infection symptoms and debridment was 35 days (range, 3-270 days). There were early postoperative infections in 13 cases, acute hematogenous infections in 24 cases, and late chronic infections in 8 cases. X-ray films showed that the location of prosthesis was good. The results of bacilli culture showed that 28 cases were positive and 17 were negative. Twelve cases had sinuses. Length of stay, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, and Harris score were recorded to evaluate risk factors by using a multivariate logistic regression. Results: The mean length of stay was 22.6 days (range, 5-79 days). All patients were followed up 24-74 months (mean, 52 months). There were 33 cases that retained the prosthesis without further evidence of infection with the success rate was 73.3%. There were significant differences in Harris score and HSS score between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). The univariate analysis results showed that the failure of debridement with prosthesis retention had a significant correlation with sinus developing and duration of infection symptoms more than 14 days ( P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis results showed that sinus developing was an independent risk factor of failure ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Debridement with prosthesis retention plays an important role in treating PJI after THA and TKA. These patients with sinus performing and duration of infection symptoms more than 14 days have higher risk to develop infection again.",

However, the management of preexisting hypertension is still controversial in the treatment of acute stroke in hypertensive patients. The present study evaluates the influence of preserving hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia on stroke outcome in a rat model of chronic hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient (1h) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, during which mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at normotension (110-120mm Hg, group 1, n=6) or hypertension (160-170mm Hg, group 2, n=6) using phenylephrine. T2-, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI were performed serially at five different time points: before and during ischemia, and at 1, 4 and 7 days after ischemia. Lesion volume and brain edema were estimated from apparent diffusion coefficient maps and T2-weighted images. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured within and outside the perfusion deficient lesion and in the corresponding regions of the contralesional hemisphere. Neurological deficits were evaluated after reperfusion. Infarct volume, edema, and neurological deficits were significantly reduced in group 2 vs. group 1. In addition, higher values and rapid restoration of rCBF were observed in group 2, while rCBF in both hemispheres was significantly decreased in group 1. Maintaining preexisting hypertension alleviates ischemic brain injury in SHR by increasing collateral circulation to the ischemic region and allowing rapid restoration of rCBF. The data suggest that maintaining preexisting hypertension is a valuable approach to managing hypertensive patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke.",

This study evaluates the therapeutic effect of an alternative technique that uses a modified approach of epidural steroid injection for the above mentioned disease. The aim was to determine whether this procedure can reduce the need of surgery among discectomy candidates. METHODS: Twenty-one eligible patients who had suffered from sciatica with unilateral symptoms for 2 to 24 months received injections of betamethasone in combination with xylocaine. The treatment outcome was evaluated by direct questioning and examination using the JOA score (the criteria for low back pain syndrome of Japanese Orthopaedic Association) before the procedure and at the final follow-up visit. The final analysis comprised 19 patients with a minimum of 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: The overall JOA score increased significantly from 14.26 +/- 3.25 before injection to 23.38 +/- 4.46 after injection showing improvement. In terms of subcategories, the JOA score for sciatica increased significantly from 0.69 +/- 0.48 before infection to 2.13 +/- 0.72 after injection and the JOA score for daily activity increased significantly from 7.44 +/- 2.16 before injection to 12.19 +/- 2.23 after injection). In the end, three treated patients received surgical decompression for intractable recurrent pain. CONCLUSIONS: Transforaminal epidural steroid injection is a relatively simple, effective and low-risk alternative to surgical decompression for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation in selected cases. The procedure significantly alleviates the severity of sciatica due to a herniated disc and improves the patient's daily activity; this reduces the need for surgical decompression.",

There are several risk factors associated with non-adherence, including cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety. Nevertheless, studies on therapeutic adherence in older patients with DM are scarce. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze whether adherence to medication, PA and diet are associated with cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. It also aimed to identity predictors of medication non-adherence. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of older patients (\u2265 65 years old) with DM was carried out in the Outpatient Department of Internal Medicine Service of CHUSJ-Porto, Portugal. Those unable to communicate were excluded. Cognition (mini-mental state examination), anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale) were assessed. Adherence to medication, PA and diet was measured, based on self-reporting patient/family, questionnaires, physician clinical opinion, hemoglobin test and pharmacy records. Patient groups were compared, using the Mann-Whitney or the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and the Chi-square test for paired categorical variables (significance level of 0.05). The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to identify independent predictors of non-adherence to medication. RESULTS: The final sample (n = 94) had a mean age of 75.2 years (standard deviation: 6.7) and mostly were female (53.2%), married (63.8%) and with a low education level (61.7%). Also, 22.3% with cognitive impairment, 16% with depression and 23.4% with anxiety were found. Patients non-adherent to medication had higher depression (P = 0.048) and anxiety (P = 0.010), compared to adherents/partial adherents. Patients non-adherent to PA showed higher anxiety (P = 0.035) and depression (P = 0.004), compared to adherents. Non-adherents to PA had more cognitive impairment than adherents (26.3% vs. 0%; P = 0.034). Patients who had insulin prescribed presented a higher risk of non-adherence to medication (OR: 4.041, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.404 - 11.628; P = 0.010). Also, the risk of non-adherence to medication is higher by an increase of one unit in anxiety (OR: 1.252, 95% CI: 1.046 - 1.499; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Higher anxiety and depression were associated with non-adherence to medication and to PA. Insulin prescribed and high anxiety scores were predictors of medication non-adherence. This study appears to contribute to the knowledge about the influence of cognitive and psychological factors in therapeutic adherence in these older diabetic patients.",

        "a": "In recent decades, the incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased notably. Candida albicans (C. albicans), a common opportunistic fungal pathogen that dwells on human mucosal surfaces, can cause fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised and high-risk surgical patients. In addition, the wide use of antifungal agents has likely contributed to resistance of C. albicans to traditional antifungal drugs, increasing the difficulty of treatment. Thus, it is urgent to identify novel antifungal drugs to cope with C. albicans infections. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) exist in most organisms and are expressed in response to thermal stress. In C. albicans, Hsps control basic physiological activities or virulence via interaction with a variety of diverse regulators of cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Hsps confer drug resistance to C. albicans. Many studies have shown that disrupting the normal functions of C. albicans Hsps inhibits fungal growth or reverses the tolerance of C. albicans to traditional antifungal drugs. Here, we review known functions of the diverse Hsp family, Hsp-associated intracellular signaling pathways and potential antifungal targets based on these pathways in C. albicans. We hope this review will aid in revealing potential new roles of C. albicans Hsps in addition to canonical heat stress adaptions and provide more insight into identifying potential novel antifungal targets.",

        "a": "Introduction Heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (Propaten, WL Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) have been shown to have superior patency compared to standard prosthetic grafts in leg bypass. This study analyzed the outcomes of Propaten grafts with distal anastomotic patch versus autogenous saphenous vein grafts in tibial artery bypass. Methods A retrospective analysis of prospective collected data was performed during a recent 15-year period. Sixty-two Propaten bypass grafts with distal anastomotic patch (Propaten group) were compared with 46 saphenous vein graft (vein group). Pertinent clinical variables including graft patency and limb salvage were analyzed. Results Both groups had similar clinical risk factors, bypass indications, and target vessel for tibial artery anastomoses. Decreased trends of operative time (196\u2009\u00b1\u200934 min vs. 287\u2009\u00b1\u200965 min, p\u2009=\u20090.07) and length of hospital stay (5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 days vs. 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6, p\u2009=\u20090.08) were noted in the Propaten group compared to the vein group. Similar primary patency rates were noted at four years between the Propaten and vein groups (85%, 71%, 64%, and 57%, vs. 87%, 78%, 67%, and 61% respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.97). Both groups had comparable secondary patency rates yearly in four years (the Propaten group: 84%, 76%, 74%, and 67%, respectively; the vein group: 88%, 79%, 76%, and 72%, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.94). The limb salvage rates were equivalent between the Propaten and vein group at four years (84% vs. 92%, p\u2009=\u20090.89). Multivariate analysis showed active tobacco usage and poor run-off score as predictors for graft occlusion. Conclusions Propaten grafts with distal anastomotic patch have similar clinical outcomes compared to the saphenous vein graft in tibial artery bypass. Our data support the use of Propaten graft with distal anastomotic patch as a viable conduit of choice in patients undergoing tibial artery bypass.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Cost of illness studies are needed to provide estimates for input into cost-effectiveness studies and as information drivers to resource allocation. However, these studies often do not differentiate costs associated with the disease of interest and costs of co-morbidities. The goal of this study was to identify the 1-year cost of ischemic stroke compared to the annual cost of care for a comparable non-stroke group of South Carolina (SC) Medicare beneficiaries resulting in a marginal cost estimate. METHODS: SC data for 2004 and 2005 were used to estimate the mean 12\u00a0month cost of stroke for 2,976 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for Ischemic Stroke in 2004. Using nearest neighbor propensity score matching, a control group of non-stroke beneficiaries were matched on age, gender, race, risk factors, and Charlson comorbidity index and their costs were calculated. Marginal cost attributable to ischemic stroke was calculated as the difference between these two adjusted cost estimates. RESULTS: The total cost estimated for SC stroke patients for 1\u00a0year (2004) was $81.3 million. The cost for the matched comparison group without stroke was $54.4 million. Thus, the 2004 marginal costs to Medicare due to Ischemic stroke in SC are estimated to be $26.9 million. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate estimates of cost of care for conditions, such as stroke, that are common in older patients with a high rate of comorbid conditions require the use of a marginal costing approach. Over estimation of cost of care for stroke may lead to prediction of larger savings than realizable from important stroke treatment and prevention programs, which may damage the credibility of program advocates, and jeopardize long term funding support. Additionally, correct cost estimates are needed as inputs for valid cost-effectiveness studies. Thus, it is important to use marginal costing for stroke, especially with the increasing public focus on evidence-based economic decision making to be expected with healthcare reform.",

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the long-term efficacy of ETV and TDF in HCC recurrence and overall survival (OS) of patients after curative hepatectomy. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2019, 20,572 patients with HCC who received hepatectomy were screened for study eligibility. Finally, a total of 219 consecutive patients treated with ETV (n = 146) or TDF (n = 73) after curative hepatectomy for HBV-related HCC of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A were analyzed by propensity score matching (PSM) (2:1) analysis and competing risk analysis. HCC recurrence and OS of patients were compared between ETV and TDF groups. RESULT: After a median follow-up of 52.2 months, 81 patients (37.0%) had HCC recurrence, 33 (15.1%) died, and 5 (2.3%) received liver transplantation. TDF therapy was an independent protective factor for HCC recurrence compared with ETV therapy (HR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.027-2.770, p = 0.039); however, no difference in the risk of death or liver transplantation. Results were similar in competing risk analysis. We further found that TDF therapy was significantly associated with a lower risk of late recurrence (HR, 4.705; 95% CI, 1.763-12.558, p = 0.002), but not in early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: TDF therapy is associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC recurrence, especially of late recurrence, than ETV therapy among patients who undergo curative hepatectomy for HBV-related early-stage HCC.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: To evaluate erectile function in patients with Peyronies disease (PD) who underwent corporoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 374 patients who underwent corporoplasty by a single surgeon during 1996-2016 were analyzed. In all cases IIEF questionnaire was evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Intracavernous injection test and penile doppler ultrasonography were performed if required. Median follow-up was 9.5 years. Analysis of risk factors for erectile dysfunction (ED) before and after corporoplasty was performed. RESULTS: Prevalence of risk factors for ED in our sample has greatly increased during follow-up. At the last follow-up visit 285 patients were sexually active. Evaluation of patient satisfaction with the quality of erections has shown that 139 patients were fully satisfied (48.8%), 84 patients were somewhat satisfied (29.5%) and 62 patients were not satisfied with their erectile function (21.7%). According to IIEF questionnaire, 105 patients (36.8%) had no ED (> 26 points); 74 patients (26%) had mild ED; 67 patients (23.5%) had mild-to-moderate ED; 21 patients (7.4%) had moderate ED; and 18 patients (6.3%) had severe ED. However, a causal relationship between ED and treatment of Peyronie's disease was found not in all cases. Seven patients had infrequent sexual intercourse (1-2 per month) and 50 patients had no sexual activity. DISCUSSION: At long term after corporoplasty some patients experience ED, though causality between ED and PD treatment couldnt be confirmed in all such cases. It should be noted that we have found an increase in prevalence of independent risk factors for ED during follow-up period. These patients could possibly benefit in terms of quality of life if they underwent penile prosthesis placement during primary surgical treatment for PD. However, some patients had no sexual activity due to causes unrelated to ED. CONCLUSION: Not all patients with PD are satisfied with their sexual functioning after corporoplasty. However, ED after surgical management of PD is not always a consequence of surgery itself.",

METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Patients hospitalised due to influenza virus infection were recruited. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, vaccinations, toxic habits, previous medications, exposure to social environments, and EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D). Severe pneumonia with multilobar involvement and/or shock (SPAS) was the primary outcome of interest. We constructed two multivariate logistic regression models to explain the likelihood of developing SPAS and to create a clinical prediction rule for developing SPAS that includes clinically relevant variables. RESULTS: Laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09, EQ-5D utility score 7 days before admission, more than one comorbidity, altered mental status, dyspnoea on arrival, days from onset of symptoms, and influenza season were associated with SPAS. In addition, not being vaccinated against seasonal influenza in the previous year, anaemia, altered mental status, fever and dyspnoea on arrival at hospital, difficulties in performing activities of daily living in the previous 7 days, and days from onset of symptoms to arrival at hospital were related to the likelihood of SPAS (area under the curve value of 0.75; Hosmer-Lemeshow p value of 0.84).

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \"a state of well-being in which every individual realizes own potential, can cope with the normal pressures of life, is able to work effectively, and can make a contribution to community\". OBJECTIVES: Mental Health Problems (MHP) is a great concern for all societies in terms of its burden and impact. This survey screened MHP and its impact in an Iranian urban population aged 6 - 12 years old, and explored its associated socio-familial factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The survey was conducted in the elementary schools of Semnan, using random cluster sampling. Collection and analysis of data was performed using the parent version of the \"Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)\" and survey commands of Stata-nine, taking into account cluster effect and population weights. Associations were assessed by fitting simple and multiple logistic regression models. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: With regard to the SDQ total score, 19.3% (95% CI: 8.6, 30.1) scored above the normal threshold (9.6% abnormal, 9.7% borderline). The frequency of problems ranged between 16.1% (peer problems) and 8.4% (emotional symptoms), and in all subscales boys were affected more than girls. The impact score was abnormal in 68.4% of all children, and was greater in girls than in boys. \"A previously diagnosed mental health disorder\" (OR = 11.11, 95% CI: 5.55, 25.00), \"male gender\" (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.87 and \"less time spent with the child by father\" (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.17) were significantly associated with an abnormal SDQ. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of MHP in 6 - 12 year-old children and the lack of any significant correlation with their age, underpins the importance of early screening for MHP in schools, with particular focus on high risk groups.",

There is, however, an option to stop controller medication if the patient has been well-controlled for at least 6-12 months. To assess control, both clinical symptom assessment and lung function should be monitored periodically. In practical clinical practice of pediatric patients, lung function is not available at all health centers. OBJECTIVES: to determine lung function with a focus on small airway function and the risk of reversibility among children who have been symptom-controlled. METHODS: Our participants were symptom-controlled asthmatic children according to GINA Guideline for at least 6 months with low dose inhaled corticosteroid. Written informed-consent was given by the parents and the children. They performed a self-evaluated symptom-controlled test (C-ACT) and a spirometric assessment. Abnormal lung function was defined as FEV1\u00b180%, FEV1/FVC < 80%, and FEF25-75 <65% predicted. Airway reversibility was determined by the change of FEV1 >12% and FEF25-75 >30% post bronchodilator. RESULTS: Forty children (65% male) were enrolled. Age ranged between 6.7 and 15.0 years. The mean C-ACT score was 25.2 \u00b1 1.7. Spirometry results were: mean FEV1 84.0 %, FEV1/FVC 87.8%, and FEF25-75 85.5% predicted. Normal FEV1 was found among 72.5% of participants compared to normal FEF25-75 in 87.5%. Among the abnormal FEV1 and FEF25-75, all were of mild severity as 10% retained airway reversibility. CONCLUSION: Children with well-controlled asthma, based on their symptom assessment, may have persistent abnormal lung function. Spirometry should be performed before considering cessation of controller medication.",

        "a": "Background: Ischemic events after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in carotid artery stenosis patients are unforeseeable and alarming. Therefore, we aimed to establish a novel model to prevent recurrent ischemic events after CEA. Methods: Ninety-eight peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected from carotid artery stenosis patients. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we performed whole transcriptome correlation analysis and extracted the key module related to ischemic events. The biological functions of the 292 genes in the key module were annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via the STRING database and Cytoscape software. The enrolled samples were divided into train (n = 66), validation (n = 28), and total sets (n = 94). In the train set, the random forest algorithm was used to identify critical genes for predicting ischemic events after CEA, and further dimension reduction was performed by LASSO logistic regression. A diagnosis model was established in the train set and verified in the validation and total sets. Furthermore, fifty peripheral venous blood samples from patients with carotid stenosis in our hospital were used as an independent cohort to validation the model by RT-qPCR. Meanwhile, GSEA, ssGSEA, CIBERSORT, and MCP-counter were used to enrichment analysis in high- and low-risk groups, which were divided by the median risk score. Results: We established an eight-gene model consisting of PLSCR1, ECRP, CASP5, SPTSSA, MSRB1, BCL6, FBP1, and LST1. The ROC-AUCs and PR-AUCs of the train, validation, total, and independent cohort were 0.891 and 0.725, 0.826 and 0.364, 0.869 and 0.654, 0.792 and 0.372, respectively. GSEA, ssGSEA, CIBERSORT, and MCP-counter analyses further revealed that high-risk patients presented enhanced immune signatures, which indicated that immunotherapy may improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Conclusion: An eight-gene model with high accuracy for predicting ischemic events after CEA was constructed. This model might be a promising tool to facilitate the clinical management and postoperative surveillance of carotid artery stenosis patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Mitral valve repair (MVR) is the preferred method of treatment of the complex floppy mitral valve. Immediate repair failure, due to systolic anterior motion (SAM), is related to excessive anterior mitral valve leaflet (AMVL) tissue and/or anterior displacement of the leaflet coaptation point by the posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) with resultant left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Herein are reported the authors' experience of the AMVL valvuloplasty, a simple alternative to the sliding technique, to prevent post-MVR SAM. METHODS: Between January 1996 and June 2003, elliptical excisions of the base of the AMVL and annuloplasty rings (nine Physio, 38 Seguin) were performed in 47 patients (mean age 66 years; range: 29-86 years). The surgical procedure included posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) resection in 37 patients (80%), AMVL resection in 28 (61%), and transposition flaps in nine (19%). Four patients (8%) had a tricuspid valve repair, six (13%) had an aortic valve replacement, and nine (19%) had coronary bypass grafting. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography before and after MVR was performed to assess mitral valve anatomy, the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), and SAM. RESULTS: There was no postoperative SAM. The severity of MR was reduced to trace or mild in all 47 patients. The mean AMVL length was 3.0 cm before and 2.2 cm after MVR, a tissue reduction of 27%. In those patients with a PMVL resection, the mean length was decreased from 1.95 cm to 1.5 cm, a tissue reduction of 23%. The mean annulus diameter decreased from 3.9 cm to 3.0 cm. The mean AMVL:PMVL ratio decreased from 1.6 to 1.4. The proportional size reduction of the AMVL compared to the PMVL was 17%. The mean coaptation point to annulus distance (CPAD) decreased from 1.1 cm to 0.9 cm. There was no 30-day in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: The AMVL valvuloplasty eliminated postoperative SAM. There was both reduction of the AMVL surface area, limiting the excursion of the AMVL into the LVOT, and reduction of CPAD. This technique does not compromise the geometry of the mitral valve apparatus.",

These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725-0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734-0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions: ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or tailored therapy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at higher risk for complications after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) than patients without DM. Potent antithrombotic therapies may offer particular benefit for these high-risk patients and must be balanced against the potential for increased bleeding. METHODS: We performed a prospectively planned analysis of efficacy and safety in patients with DM among 20,479 patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolysis and randomized to a strategy of enoxaparin (up to 8 days) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) (48 hours) in ExTRACT-TIMI 25. RESULTS: Patients with DM (n = 3060) were older and more likely to be women and to present with heart failure (P < .0001 for each) than those without DM. After adjustment for the TIMI Risk Score, sex, and renal function, patients with DM were at 30% higher risk for death or myocardial infarction (MI) by 30 days (OR(adj) 1.29, 95% CI 1.14-1.46). Among patients with DM, the enoxaparin strategy reduced mortality (9.5% vs 11.8%, relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99), death/MI (13.6% vs 17.1%, RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.94), and death/MI/urgent revascularization (16.0% vs 19.7%, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94). The enoxaparin strategy was associated with a trend toward higher major bleeding (2.6% vs 1.6%, RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.99-2.69). Taking efficacy and safety into account, the enoxaparin strategy offered superior net clinical benefit (death/MI/major bleed, 14.8% vs 18.0%, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.97) compared with UFH in patients with DM. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup analysis, a reperfusion strategy including enoxaparin significantly improved outcomes compared with UFH among high-risk STEMI patients with DM undergoing fibrinolysis.",

        "a": "Shock is a sequelae in trauma and burn patients that substantially increases the risk for morbidity and mortality. The use of resuscitation endpoints allows for improved management of these patients, with the potential to prevent further morbidity/mortality. We conducted a review of the current literature on the efficacy of hemodynamic, metabolic, and regional resuscitation endpoints for use in trauma and burn patients. Hemodynamic endpoints included mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), urinary output (UO), compensatory reserve index (CRI), intrathoracic blood volume, and stroke volume variation (SVV). Metabolic endpoints measure cellular responses to decreased oxygen delivery and include serum lactic acid (LA), base deficit (BD), bicarbonate, anion gap, apparent strong ion difference, and serum pH. Mean arterial pressure, HR, UO, and LA are the most established markers of trauma and burn resuscitation. The evidence suggests LA is a superior metabolic endpoint marker. Newer resuscitation endpoint technologies such as point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS), thromboelastography (TEG), and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) may improve patient outcomes; however, additional research is needed to establish the efficacy in trauma and burn patients. The endpoints discussed have situational strengths and weaknesses and no single universal resuscitation endpoint has yet emerged. This review may increase knowledge and aid in guideline development. We recommend clinicians continue to integrate multiple endpoints with emphasis on MAP, HR, UO, LA, and BD. Future investigation should aim to standardize endpoints for each clinical presentation. The search for universal and novel resuscitation parameters in trauma and burns should also continue.",

All four had elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels and large lesions with strong peripheral color Doppler signals, indicating possible risk of profuse bleeding, and all four women wished to preserve their fertility. HIFU was performed under local anesthesia. Success of the treatment in all four cases was indicated by complete primary evacuation of the CSP and return of serum hCG to normal levels (serum hCG < 20 mIU/mL). However, one patient in whom there was a large scar defect and placental implantation underwent laparotomy to remove the trophoblastic tissue and repair the defect, although the hCG level had already returned to normal levels. HIFU, by utilizing ultrasound energy to heat tissue at a focal point, is able to stop embryonic cardiac activity and leads to a rapid reduction in serum hCG levels. Subsequent D&C under hysteroscopic guidance enables complete removal of products of conception following the HIFU procedure.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and exhibits both high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, scientists have made substantial breakthroughs in the early diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), however, patient prognosis still shows vast individual differences. In this study, bioinformatics methods were used to identify and analyze ferroptosis-related genes to establish an effective signature for predicting prognosis in LUAD patients. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of LUAD patients with complete clinical and follow-up information were downloaded from two public databases, univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to obtain ferroptosis-related genes for constructing the prognos tic risk model, AUC and calibration plot were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the FRGS and nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 74 ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi fied between LUAD and normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A five-gene panel for prediction of LUAD prognosis was established by multivariate regression and was verified using the GSE68465 cohort from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Patients were divided into two different risk groups according to the median risk score of the five genes. Based on Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysi, the OS rate of the high-risk group was markedly worse than that of the low-risk group. We also found that risk score was an independent prognostic indicator. The receiver operating characteristic ROC curve showed that the proposed model had good prediction ability. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional analyses indicated that risk score was prominently enriched in ferroptosis processes. Moreover, at the score of immune-associated gene sets, significant differences were found between the two risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ferroptosis-related gene signatures can be used as a potential predictor for the prognosis of LUAD, thus providing a novel strategy for individualized treatment in LUAD patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The EPA/AA ratio has emerged as a predictor of mortality endpoints in cardiac disease; however, its prognostic value in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients is unclear. We assessed the serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid (AA) ratio in patients with PAD caused by femoropopliteal artery lesions, to determine whether it predicts clinical outcomes after endovascular therapy (EVT). METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained serum EPA/AA ratios from 132 consecutive patients with PAD caused by femoropopliteal artery lesions before EVT. Patients were divided into two groups using the median value of serum EPA/AA ratios of the entire cohort; LOW group with the levels \u22640.30 (n = 66) and HIGH group >0.30 (n = 66). The incidence of major adverse events (MAE), including major adverse limb events (MALE) and death from any cause, was determined. At a median follow-up interval of 24 months, MALE occurred in 40 patients (30.3%) and 11 patients (8.3%) died. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated the survival probability from MAE was significantly worse in patients with EPA/AA ratio under the median (long-rank test \u03c7(2) = 16.4; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed critical limb ischemia (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84 to 6.46; p < 0.001) and the preprocedural serum EPA/AA ratios \u22640.30 (HR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.33 to 5.65; p = 0.006) independently predicted MAE after EVT. CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum EPA/AA ratios appear to be associated with a greater risk of MALE and death from any cause after EVT in patients with PAD caused by femoropopliteal artery lesions.",

        "a": "Background: More than 2% of the general population experience suicidal ideas each year and a large number of them will attempt suicide. Evidence-based therapeutic options to manage suicidal crisis are currently limited. Objectives: The aim of this study was to overview the findings on the use of ketamine and esketamine for the treatment of suicidal ideas and acts. Design: Systematic review. Data Sources and methods: PubMed, article references, and Clinicaltrials.gov up to June 30, 2022. Meta-analyses published within the last 2\u2009years were also reviewed. Results: We identified 12 randomized controlled trials with reduction of suicidal ideation as the primary objective and 14 trials as secondary objectives. Intravenous racemic ketamine was superior to control drugs (placebo or midazolam) within the first 72\u2009h, in spite of large placebo effects. Adverse events were minor and transient. In contrast, intranasal esketamine did not differ from placebo in large-scale studies. Limitations, clinical considerations, and opportunities for future research include the following points: large placebo effects when studying suicidal ideation reduction; small concerns about blinding quality due to dissociative effects; no studies on the risk/prevention of suicidal acts and mortality; lack of studies beyond affective disorders; no studies in adolescents and older people; lack of knowledge of long-term side effects, notably liability for abuse; no robust predictive markers; limited understanding of the mechanisms of ketamine on suicidal ideas; need for improved assessment of suicidal ideation in clinical trials; need for studies in outpatient settings, emergency room, and liaison consultation; need for research on ketamine administration; limited knowledge on the positive and negative effects of concomitant treatments. Conclusion: Overall, there is compelling evidence for a favorable short-term benefit-risk balance with intravenous racemic ketamine but not intranasal esketamine. The place of ketamine will have to be defined within a multimodal care strategy for suicidal patients. Caution remains necessary for clinical use, and pharmacovigilance will be essential.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the timing and risk factors for PPM implantation after mitral or aortic valve surgery. METHODS: All patients who underwent open aortic or mitral valve surgery between January 1996 and December 2014 were reviewed using New York State's mandatory hospital discharge database. Patients with prior cardiac surgery or pre-existing PPM were excluded. The primary endpoint was PPM implantation within 1 year. RESULTS: Among 77,882 patients, 63.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a049,706) underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR), 18.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a014,686) underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR), 10.5% (n\u00a0=\u00a08,219) underwent mitral valve repair (MVr), 5.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a04,202) underwent AVR plus MVR, and 1.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a01,069) underwent AVR plus MVr. The 1-year PPM implantation rate was 4.5% after MVr, 6.6% after AVR, 9.3% after AVR plus MVr, 10.5% after MVR, and 13.3% after AVR plus MVR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Across all groups, the majority of PPMs were implanted during the index hospitalization (79.9%). MVr was associated with the lowest risk for PPM and AVR plus MVR with the highest risk. Older age, history of arrhythmias, pre-operative conduction disturbances, and concomitant index procedures were associated with increased risk for PPM during the index hospitalization. Conversely, beyond 30\u00a0days, chronic comorbidities were associated with increased risk for PPM. CONCLUSIONS: Conduction disturbances requiring PPM remain a common adverse event after valve surgery. Identifying patients at risk for PPM will help facilitate perioperative planning and inform clinical decision making regarding post-operative rhythm surveillance.",

A sample of 90 consecutive Caucasian patients (aged 33-88 years), treated with at least one ITI-implant participated in this retrospective investigation. Standardized periapical radiographs were taken after prosthetic rehabilitation (133.6 days, SD 136.9 days) and at the time of the re-examination, on average 5.6 years (SD 2.5 years) thereafter. The radiographs were analyzed by a calibrated examiner for changes in peri-implant bone levels. The examiner was blind with respect to clinical parameters and IL-1 status. The distance between the implant shoulder and the first visible bone-implant contact (DIB) at the respective time points were measured using a computerized method. The absolute bone level difference during the years of service (ABL) and the annual bone loss (DeltaBL/year) were calculated for all the implants. Percentages of full mouth bleeding on probing (BOP), as well as of BOP calculated separately for teeth and implants, were determined for all visits and averaged for the entire observation period. Out of the total patient sample, there were 14 heavy smokers (= 20 cigarettes/day), 14 moderate smokers (5-19 cigarettes/day), 23 previous smokers (smoking cessation > 5 years) and 39 non-smokers. Twenty-eight (31.11%) patients were IL-1 genotype positive. Upon stratification for smoking status, significant differences were found for the variables ABL (P < 0.04, U-test) and DeltaBL/year (P < 0.04, U-test) between non-smokers and heavy smokers for the IL-1 genotype positive group but not for the IL-1 genotype negative group. Moreover, significant differences in ABL (P < 0.04, U-test) and DeltaBL/year (P < 0.04, U-test) were identified between former smokers and heavy smokers for the IL-1 genotype positive group. The differences in inflammatory parameters (BOP) did not reach statistical significance. This study suggests that in heavy cigarette smokers, carriage of a functionally significant IL-1 gene complex polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for peri-implant bone loss following prosthetic reconstruction and during the supportive periodontal care phase of the treatment.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Polyethylene wear and subsequent periprosthetic osteolysis remain a major concern of total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure in young, active patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The literature is lacking regarding the long-term performance of highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) in these patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term results for cementless THA using metal-on-HXLPE bearing couplings in patients younger than 50 years with ONFH. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiographic results of a consecutive series of 85 THAs (in 67 patients) performed with HXLPE liners (Durasul) in patients younger than 50 years who had ONFH. All procedures were performed at a single institution by a single surgeon using the same type of implants. The minimum duration of follow-up was 10 years (mean, 13.5 years; range, 10-17.3 years). Wear was measured using computer software. Osteolysis was evaluated with the use of radiography and computed tomography. RESULTS: The mean Harris hip score was 49.3 points (range, 26-68 points) before surgery, which improved to 93.6 points (range, 87-98 points) after surgery. Neither femoral nor acetabular components displayed mechanical loosening, and no components had been revised by the final follow-up evaluation. Radiographs and computed tomography scans did not demonstrate osteolysis. The mean liner wear was 0.037 mm/y (range, 0-0.099 mm/y). With the data available, univariate regression analysis did not demonstrate that age, sex, weight, activity level, underlying cause of osteonecrosis, liner thickness, or cup inclination had any influence on liner penetration. CONCLUSION: Although the long-term effects of HXLPE particles remain unknown, the implant survivorship rate and wear rate in our study are promising and support the continued use of metal-on-HXLPE bearing couplings in these high-risk patients because they do not produce any of the issues associated with hard-on-hard couplings.

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether there is a difference in clinical outcomes between isolated MAT and MAT combined with other procedures (combined MAT). STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and systematic review. METHODS: For the comparison of clinical outcomes between isolated MAT and combined MAT, the authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies that separately reported the clinical outcomes of isolated MAT and combined MAT were included. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and complication, reoperation, survivorship, and failure rates. We conducted a meta-analysis of the PROs that were used in more than 3 studies. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included in this study. In the meta-analysis, no significant differences in Lysholm scores (95% CI, -5.92 to 1.55; P = .25), Tegner activity scores (95% CI, -0.54 to 0.22; P = .41), International Knee Documentation Committee subjective scores (95% CI, -5.67 to 3.37; P = .62), and visual analog scale scores (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.94; P = .16) were observed between isolated MAT and combined MAT. For PROs that were not included in the meta-analysis, most studies reported no significant difference between the 2 groups. As for the survivorship and failure rates, studies showed varying outcomes. Four studies reported that additional procedures did not affect MAT failure or survivorship. However, 3 studies reported that ligament surgery, realignment osteotomy, and osteochondral autograft transfer were risk factors of failure. One study reported that the medial MAT group in which high tibial osteotomy was performed showed a higher survival rate than the isolated medial MAT group. CONCLUSION: Overall, there seems to be no significant difference between the postoperative PROs in terms of isolated MAT and combined MAT. However, more data are required to verify the effects of osteotomy and cartilage procedures on the clinical outcomes of MAT. We could not draw conclusions about the differences in complication, reoperation, survivorship, and failure rates between the 2 groups because we did not obtain sufficient data.",

        "a": "Steroids in susceptible individuals can cause a clinical condition similar to primary open-angle glaucoma. Five percent of the population are high steroid responders and develop an intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation of more than 15 mm Hg above baseline. IOP elevation may occur as early as 1 day to as late as 12 weeks after intravitreal triamcinolone in 20-65% of patients. On average, 75% of eyes with steroid implants require IOP-lowering therapy at some point within 3 years of follow-up. The exact mechanism of steroid-induced glaucoma is not totally understood, but decreased trabecular meshwork outflow is regarded as the main cause of IOP elevation. High-risk patients who receive steroids should be monitored closely and if they develop elevated IOP, steroids with lower potency or steroid-sparing agents should be used. The IOP usually returns to normal within 2-4 weeks after stopping the steroid. About 1-5% of patients do not respond to medical therapy and need surgery. Trabeculectomy, trabeculotomy, shunt surgery, and cyclodestructive procedures are among the methods employed. Removal of residual sub-Tenon or intravitreal steroids may help hasten the resolution of the steroid response. Early results with anecortave acetate, an analog of cortisol acetate with antiangiogenic activity, in controlling IOP have been promising.",

OBJECTIVES: This study, DEFENSE-PFO (Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke Patients With High-Risk Patent Foramen Ovale), evaluated whether the benefits of PFO closure can be determined on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the PFO, as evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography. METHODS: Patients with cryptogenic stroke and high-risk PFO were divided between a transcatheter PFO closure and a medication-only group. High-risk PFO included PFO with atrial septal aneurysm, hypermobility (phasic septal excursion into either atrium\u00a0\u226510\u00a0mm), or PFO size (maximum separation of the septum primum from the secundum)\u00a0\u22652\u00a0mm. The primary endpoint was a composite of stroke, vascular death, or Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding during 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: From September 2011 until October 2017, 120 patients (mean age: 51.8 years) underwent randomization. PFO size, frequency of septal aneurysm (13.3% vs. 8.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.56), and hypermobility (45.0% vs. 46.7%; p > 0.99) were similar between the groups. All PFO closures were successful. The primary endpoint occurred exclusively in the medication-only group (6 of 60 patients; 2-year event rate: 12.9% [log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.013]; 2-year rate of ischemic stroke: 10.5% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.023]). The events in the medication-only group included ischemic stroke (n\u00a0=\u00a05), cerebral hemorrhage (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and transient ischemic attack (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Nonfatal procedural complications included development of atrial fibrillation (n\u00a0=\u00a02), pericardial effusion (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and pseudoaneurysm (n\u00a0=\u00a01). CONCLUSIONS: PFO closure in patients with high-risk PFO characteristics resulted in a lower rate of the primary endpoint as well as stroke recurrence.

        "a": "Objective: To determine the predictors of recurrent hospitalizations among atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Methods: We analyzed data from the Chinese Atrial Fibrillation Registry (CAFR), a prospective cohort study involving non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients from Augest 2011 to December 2017. A total of 5 349 NVAF patients with a minimum of 48 months follow-up were included for analysis. Data including patient demographics, complications, medical and ablation history were collected. The maximum number of all-cause hospitalizations within one-year for each patient served as the primary endpoint. Patients hospitalized less than twice within one-year were defined as non-recurrent hospitalizations group, those hospitalized at least twice within one-year were definned as recurrent hospitalizations group. Logistic regression model was used to identify associated risk factors for recurrent hospitalizations. Results: Of 5 349 NVAF patients, those hospitalized for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and at least 5 times within one-year was 2 703 (50.5%), 1 776 (33.2%), 642 (12.0%), 161(3.0), 52 (1.0%), 15 (0.3%), respectively. Eight hundred and seventy (16.3%) patients were included in recurrent hospitalizations group, 4 479 (83.7%) patients were included in non-recurrent hospitalizations group. Compare with non-recurrent hospitalizations group, patients in recurrent hospitalizations group was more likely to be older and female, more frequently had a history of hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disesase, ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, a AF duration for more than 1 year, medication including drugs for ventricular rate control, statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and higher CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores (P<0.05), but less frequently had higher education, a history of drinking, smoking and ablation (P<0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that age 50-64 (OR=1.47, 95%CI 1.20-1.80), age\u226565 (OR=1.89, 95%CI 1.50-2.38), female (OR=1.21, 95%CI 1.01-1.46), hypertension history (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.16-1.74), heart failure history (OR=1.73, 95%CI 1.37-2.18), coronary heart disease history (OR=1.63, 95%CI 1.31-2.03), peptic ulcer history (OR=2.00, 95%CI 1.18-3.39) were independent risk factors for recurrent hospitalizations, while higher education (college or above) (OR=0.82, 95%CI 0.69-0.99) was the protective factor for recurrent hospitalizations. Conclusions: Nearly 1 in 6 of AF patients were admitted to hospital more than once within one year in this NVAF cohort. Age\u226550, female, hypertension history, heart failure history, coronary heart disease history, peptic ulcer history are associated with an increased risk of recurrent hospitalizations.",

This study examined the relationship between neurocognitive functioning and medication adherence in HIV patients with (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a039) current cocaine dependence. Active users had greater neurocognitive impairment (mean T-score\u00a0=\u00a035.16 vs. 40.97, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and worse medication adherence (mean z-score\u00a0=\u00a0-0.44 vs. 0.27, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In a multiple regression model, neurocognitive functioning (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.33, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and cocaine dependence (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-.36, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) were predictive of poorer adherence. There was a significant indirect effect of cocaine dependence on medication adherence through neurocognitive impairment (estimate\u00a0=\u00a0-0.15, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), suggesting that neurocognitive impairment partially mediated the relationship between cocaine dependence and poorer adherence.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the amount of blood loss and the rate\u00a0of blood transfusion in patients receiving surgery for proximal humeral fractures depending on the treatment and fracture classification. Moreover, factors associated with blood loss and blood transfusion were analyzed. METHODS: The study included 420 patients who had received surgery for proximal humeral fractures. Data from medical records were collected retrospectively. The calculated blood loss and the transfusion rate were analyzed depending on the type of surgery (plate fixation, arthroplasty, and others) or the fracture classification (2-, 3-, and 4-part fractures). The extent of blood loss and the need for transfusion were correlated with potential risk factors. A score to estimate the probability of blood transfusion was developed. RESULTS: Average blood loss was 284 mL, and the transfusion rate was 14.5% for all proximal humeral fractures. Shoulder arthroplasty was associated with higher blood loss (353 mL, P < .01) and a higher blood transfusion rate (27.3%, P < .01) than plate fixation (263 mL and 10.9%, respectively). The fracture classification had no effect on either factor. Significant risk factors for blood loss were male sex, body mass index, surgery time, time until surgery, and vitamin K antagonists. Age, blood loss, American Society of Anesthesiologists score greater than 2, vitamin K antagonists, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and renal disease were associated with a higher transfusion rate. CONCLUSION: Blood loss could be affected by a shorter surgery time and by choosing an adequate time until surgery. The consideration of risk factors and the use of a transfusion risk score allow more elaborate ordering of cross-matched blood units and can decrease institutional costs.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: To isolate hospital effects on risk-standardized hospital-readmission rates, we examined readmission outcomes among patients who had multiple admissions for a similar diagnosis at more than one hospital within a given year. METHODS: We divided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hospital-wide readmission measure cohort from July 2014 through June 2015 into two random samples. All the patients in the cohort were Medicare recipients who were at least 65 years of age. We used the first sample to calculate the risk-standardized readmission rate within 30 days for each hospital, and we classified hospitals into performance quartiles, with a lower readmission rate indicating better performance (performance-classification sample). The study sample (identified from the second sample) included patients who had two admissions for similar diagnoses at different hospitals that occurred more than 1 month and less than 1 year apart, and we compared the observed readmission rates among patients who had been admitted to hospitals in different performance quartiles. RESULTS: In the performance-classification sample, the median risk-standardized readmission rate was 15.5% (interquartile range, 15.3 to 15.8). The study sample included 37,508 patients who had two admissions for similar diagnoses at a total of 4272 different hospitals. The observed readmission rate was consistently higher among patients admitted to hospitals in a worse-performing quartile than among those admitted to hospitals in a better-performing quartile, but the only significant difference was observed when the patients were admitted to hospitals in which one was in the best-performing quartile and the other was in the worst-performing quartile (absolute difference in readmission rate, 2.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 3.5; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When the same patients were admitted with similar diagnoses to hospitals in the best-performing quartile as compared with the worst-performing quartile of hospital readmission performance, there was a significant difference in rates of readmission within 30 days. The findings suggest that hospital quality contributes in part to readmission rates independent of factors involving patients.

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Children with neurogenic bladder (NGB) often require a lifetime of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), typically using uncoated catheters (UCs). Hydrophilic catheters (HCs) have lower friction than UCs with reported less damage to the urethra. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between these catheters. METHODS: An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare HCs versus UCs. Children aged 2-17 years with NGB on CIC were enrolled for 1 year. Block randomization was used. Dexterity scores were obtained in those who perform self-catheterization. Outcomes were UTI, difficulty passing the catheter, urethral injury, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Demographic data is presented in the Table. Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. Age and gender were similar between the groups. Fifteen patients in each group performed CIC via an abdominal wall stoma. Eight and 15 patients withdrew from the UC and HC groups, respectively. The HC group overall had more problems with the catheter, mainly difficulty with handling. There were no differences for passing the catheter, pain, hematuria, or urethral injuries. There were two urinary tract infections (UTIs) in two HC patients and 17 UTIs in seven UC patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Patients with UTIs in the HC group went from 16% in the previous year to 5% during the study. Three children in the HC group had three or more UTIs in the year before enrollment and none during the study. The patients that completed the study with HC were overall satisfied and many requested to continue with the\u00a0HC. CONCLUSIONS: HCs may decrease the risk of UTI in children with\u00a0NGB.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and fatal interstitial lung disease associated with poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Reliable predictors of outcome in daily clinical practice are needed to determine high-risk patients for urgent lung transplantation referral. This study aimed to identify practical prognostic predictors of mortality using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in IPF subjects. METHODS: Thirty-four subjects with IPF (22 men and 12 women), median age 68 (range 50-81) y were prospectively studied. At baseline, all subjects were assessed with CPET and were followed up for 40 months from baseline. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine cut-off points of CPET variables for mortality, Cox regression analysis for survival using a log-rank test, and hazard ratio for death using a Wald test. RESULTS: Peak work rate <62 watts (P = .005), peak V\u0307O2 \u226413.8 mL/kg/min (P = .031), tidal volume reserve \u22640.48 L/breath (P = .010), minute ventilation to carbon dioxide (V\u0307E)/V\u0307CO2 ) ratio at the anaerobic threshold >34 (P = .02), and V\u0307E)/V\u0307O2 nadir >34 (P = .002) were detected as cut-off points associated with mortality. Non-survivor subjects were characterized by higher dyspnea levels, the presence of pulmonary hypertension assessed by echocardiography, pronounced inefficient ventilatory pattern, lower exercise capacity, and more severe desaturation during physical exertion. By the end of the study, 11 subjects (7 women and 4 men) died. Overall mean survival was 60%, 33.7 months (95% CI 30.2-37.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides simple, practical, and novel cut-off points for CPET as predictors of prognosis to identify high-risk IPF subjects. Impairment in exercise capacity and abnormal ventilatory responses during CPET were associated with poorer survival in IPF subjects. The findings suggest considering the use of CPET for IPF risk stratification and prediction of prognosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01499745.).",

Beyond their favorable therapeutic effects, GCs almost invariably provoke bone loss and a rapid increase in bone fragility, with its host of fractures. Men and postmenopausal women constitute a preferential target for the bone complications of GCs. The premenopausal status is not, however, a shelter; bone loss also happens in young women who are on GCs. Exposure to GCs yields a fracture risk exceeding the risk conferred by a low BMD per se. Therefore, some reason exists to settle the BMD threshold for therapeutic intervention not at -2.5 T-scores but at -1.0 or -1.5 T-scores, even if no prospective randomized trial so far endorses that opinion. Nowadays, bisphosphonate therapy should be proposed to every patient at risk for fragility fracture, along with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder. The prevalence of IBS in Asian countries varies from 2.9% to 15.6%. IBS does not result in increased mortality, but is associated with psychological distress and disruption of work and sleep. Consequently, the evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure for patients with IBS since it provides a holistic assessment of the patient's emotional, social and physical function. However, some HRQoL tools can be time-consuming to apply. EQ-5D is a brief HRQoL tool which has been validated in the Western IBS population but has thus far not been used in Asia. This study was conducted to determine whether persons with self-reported symptoms that met the Rome III criteria for IBS had a poorer quality of life than those without these symptoms. We also aimed to determine which specific aspects of quality of life were most affected and whether any risk factors distinguished those with and without IBS. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires which included the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire modules for IBS and the EQ-5D questionnaire were obtained from participants of a health symposium in Singapore on 31th October 2010. IBS was diagnosed based on the Rome III Criteria. The main outcome measure was the EQ-5D index score. The relationship between the presence of IBS and the EQ-5D index score, individual dimensions of EQ-5D and demographic risk factors were examined. RESULTS: 449 completed questionnaires were analyzed. The mean EQ-5D index score for IBS was 0.739 which was a significant reduction compared to non-IBS participants [-0.11 (95% CI: -0.15 to -0.07), p<0.001]. Multivariate analysis showed that IBS was significantly associated with younger age and higher education level. Of the five EQ-5D dimensions, IBS sufferers were significantly affected in mobility, anxiety or depression, usual activity and pain. There was a \"dose related\" increase in likelihood of having IBS with increased severity of pain and anxiety or depression. CONCLUSION: IBS sufferers have significantly poorer quality of life. Assessment of HRQoL in IBS using the EQ-5D should be considered in further studies and routine clinical practice.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: A patient's baseline health status may affect the ability to survive an acute illness. Emergency medicine research requires tools to adjust for confounders such as comorbid illnesses. The Charlson Comorbidity Index has been validated in many settings but not extensively in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of the Charlson Index as a predictor of one-year mortality in a population of ED patients with suspected infection. METHODS: The comorbid illness components of the Charlson Index were prospectively abstracted from the medical records of adult (age older than 18 years) ED patients at risk for infection (indicated by the clinical decision to obtain a blood culture) and weighted. Charlson scores were grouped into four previously established indices: 0 points (none), 1-2 points (low), 3-4 points (moderate), and > or =5 points (high). The primary outcome was one-year mortality assessed using the National Death Index and medical records. Cox proportional-hazards ratios were calculated, adjusting for age, gender, and markers of 28-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Between February 1, 2000, and February 1, 2001, 3,102 unique patients (96% of eligible patients) were enrolled at an urban teaching hospital. Overall one-year mortality was 22% (667/3,102). Mortality rates increased with increasing Charlson scores: none, 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.4% to 8.5%); low, 22% (95% CI = 19% to 24%); moderate, 31% (95% CI = 27% to 35%); and high, 40% (95% CI = 36% to 44%). Controlling for age, gender, and factors associated with 28-day mortality, and using the \"none\" group as a reference group, the Charlson Index predicted mortality as follows: low, odds ratio of 2.0; moderate, odds ratio of 2.5; and high, odds ratio of 4.7.

Thirty-day outcomes are frequently used in comparative-effectiveness research, but may miss a substantial number of surgical site occurrences (SSO) including surgical site infection (SSI). The objective of this study was to determine an optimal length of follow-up to detect SSI after IHR. METHODS: All adult patients undergoing open IHR at a single academic center over a 3\u00a0year period were reviewed. SSIs, non-infectious SSOs, and wound-related readmissions were recorded up to 180\u00a0days. The primary outcome was the proportion of SSIs detected at end-points of 30, 60, and 90\u00a0days of follow-up. Time-to-event analysis was performed for all outcomes at 30, 60, 90, and 180\u00a0days. Logistic regression was used estimate the relative risk of SSI for relevant risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients underwent open IHR. Median follow-up time of 102\u00a0days. Overall incidence of SSI was 15.8% with median time to occurrence of 23\u00a0days. Incidence of non-infectious SSO was 33.2%, and SSO-related readmission was 12.8%. At 30, 60, and 90\u00a0days sensitivity was 81.6%, 89.5%, and 92.1 for SSI, and 46.7%, 76.7%, and 83.3% for readmission. In regression analysis, body mass index (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00, 1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.04) anterior component separation (RR 4.21, 95% CI 2.09, 6.34, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and emergency surgery (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.47, 5.02, p\u2009=\u20090.01), were independently associated with SSI after adjusting for age, sex, contamination class, and procedure duration. CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of SSIs occurred beyond 30\u00a0days, but 90-day follow-up detected 92% of SSIs. Follow-up to 90\u00a0days captured only 83% of SSO-related readmissions. These results have implications for the design of trials evaluating wound complication after open IHR, as early endpoints may miss clinically relevant outcomes\u00a0and underestimate the number needed to treat. Where possible, we recommend a minimum follow-up of 90 days to estimate wound complications following open IHR.",

        "a": "UNLABELLED: Little information exists regarding the utility circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration in hormone sensitive prostate cancer. We enumerated CTC in 33 consecutive patients undergoing androgren deprivation therapy (ADT) at our institution. Multivariate analysis revealed baseline CTC as the only independent predictor of progression to CRPC. These data suggest that baseline CTC may identify those unlikely to benefit from ADT. INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration by using the Cellsearch platform has established prognostic and predictive value in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Limited information exists regarding the clinical utility of CTC enumeration in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The goal of this study was to prospectively determine the relative clinical utility of CTCs in mHSPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed serial CTC in conjunction with other classic biomarkers in 33 consecutive patients treated at the Nevada Cancer Institute with HSPC initiating androgen deprivation therapy and correlated these patients with prognostic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) endpoints and onset of CRPC. RESULTS: Initial CTC correlated positively with lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, and were unrelated to PSA and testosterone. In univariate analysis, baseline CTC, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, and follow-up CTC were individual predictors of progression to CRPC. In a multivariate Cox regression, only baseline CTC retained independent predictive value. Threshold analysis revealed the cutpoint that optimized specificity and sensitivity of the test to be 3 cells per 7.5 mL whole blood. Baseline CTC also correlated well with PSA nadir benchmarks. CONCLUSIONS: Initial CTC values predict the duration and magnitude of response to hormonal therapy. CTC enumeration may identify patients at risk of progression to CRPC before initiation of androgen deprivation therapy.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the positive predictive value (PPV) of a clinical score for viral failure among patients fulfilling the WHO-criteria for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) failure in rural Lesotho. METHODS: Patients fulfilling clinical and/or immunological WHO failure-criteria were enrolled. The score includes the following predictors: Prior ART exposure (1 point), CD4-count below baseline (1), 25% and 50% drop from peak CD4-count (1 and 2), hemoglobin drop\u22651 g/dL (1), CD4 count<100/\u00b5l after 12 months (1), new onset papular pruritic eruption (1), and adherence<95% (3). A nurse assessed the score the day blood was drawn for viral load (VL). Reported confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Wilsons method. RESULTS: Among 1'131 patients on ART \u2265 6 months, 134 (11.8%) had immunological and/or clinical failure, 104 (78%) had blood drawn (13 died, 10 lost to follow-up, 7 did not show up). From 92 (88%) a result could be obtained (2 samples hemolysed, 10 lost). Out of these 92 patients 47 (51%) had viral failure (\u2265 5000 copies), 27 (29%) viral suppression (<40) and 18 (20%) intermediate viremia (40-4999). Overall, 20 (22%) had a score \u2265 5. A score \u2265 5 had a PPV of 100% to detect a VL>40 copies (95%CI: 84-100), and of 90% to detect a VL \u2265 5000 copies (70-97). Within the score, adherence<95%, CD4-count<100/\u00b5l and papular pruritic eruption were the strongest single predictors. Among 47 patients failing, 8 (17%) died before or within 4 weeks after being switched. Overall mortality was 4 (20%) among those with score \u2265 5 and 4 (5%) if score<5 (OR 4.3; 95%CI: 0.96-18.84, p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: A score \u2265 5 among patients fulfilling WHO-criteria had a PPV of 100% for a detectable VL and 90% for viral failure. In settings without regular access to VL-testing, this PPV may be considered high enough to switch this patient-group to second-line treatment without confirmatory VL-test.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Interscalene brachial plexus block of the C5-C6 roots provides highly effective postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery but usually results in hemidiaphragmatic paresis. Injection around the superior trunk of the brachial plexus is an alternative technique that may reduce this risk. The authors hypothesized that the superior trunk block would provide noninferior postoperative analgesia compared with the interscalene block and reduce hemidiaphragmatic paresis. METHODS: Eighty patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were randomized to receive a preoperative injection of 15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine and 5 \u03bcg \u00b7 ml epinephrine around either (1) the C5-C6 nerve roots (interscalene block group) or (2) the superior trunk (superior trunk block group). The primary outcome was pain intensity 24 h after surgery measured on an 11-point numerical rating score; the prespecified noninferiority limit was 1. Diaphragmatic function was assessed using both ultrasonographic measurement of excursion and incentive spirometry by a blinded investigator before and 30 min after block completion. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients completed the study. The pain score 24 h postoperatively (means \u00b1 SDs) was 1.4 \u00b1 1.0 versus 1.2 \u00b1 1.0 in the superior trunk block (n = 38) and interscalene block (n = 40) groups, respectively. The mean difference in pain scores was 0.1 (95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6), and the upper limit of the 95% CI was lower than the prespecified noninferiority limit. Analgesic requirements and all other pain measurements were similar between groups. Hemidiaphragmatic paresis was observed in 97.5% of the interscalene block group versus 76.3% of the superior trunk block group (P = 0.006); paresis was complete in 72.5% versus 5.3% of the patients, respectively. The decrease in spirometry values from baseline was significantly greater in the interscalene block group. CONCLUSIONS: The superior trunk block provided noninferior analgesia compared with interscalene brachial plexus block for up to 24 h after arthroscopic shoulder surgery and resulted in significantly less hemidiaphragmatic paresis.",

The present study aimed to 1) compare the anticoagulation quality and management of AF patients treated with warfarin with those on acenocoumarol and 2) optimize the SAMe-TT2R2 score to detect AF patients at high risk of unstable anticoagulation with acenocoumarol and warfarin. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective study, 320 patients with AF, including 15 (5%) after valve replacement, aged 40-82 (median 70) years, including 203 (63%) receiving acenocoumarol and 117 (37%) treated with warfarin, were studied. The SAMe-TT2R2 score was modified based on the candidate factors retrieved from univariate regression and assessed using the receiver operating curves (ROC). RESULTS: A median SAMe-TT2R2 score was 2 (1-3). Proportions of patients with \u2265 2 points and 0-1 points in the SAMe-TT2R2 score who had the time in therapeutic range (TTR) \u2264 70% were similar (61 [67%] vs. 63 [56%], p = 0.11). A modified score, involving medical history (myocardial infarction [MI] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 1 point), statin treatment (1 point) and tobacco use (2 points) had a higher area under the curve (AUC) in patients on acenocoumarol compared to SAMe- TT2R2 (0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.73 vs. 0.56; 0.48-0.64, p = 0.042); \u2265 1 point indicated TTR > 70% with a sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 63%, respectively.

        "a": "We have examined the pattern of four radiation-related neoplasms in a radiation-exposed cohort of 2795 patients. They had received conventional radiation treatments for benign conditions in the head and neck area when they were children. At the end of follow-up, 350 thyroid cancers, 108 benign and malignant salivary tumors, 87 neural tumors, and 70 cases of hyperparathyroidism had occurred. In 492 individuals (17.6% of the cohort), there were single tumors, and in 60 individuals (2.1%), there were multiple tumors. Because this was an apparent excess of multiple tumors, we tested the hypothesis that the excess arose, at least in part, from variation in radiation susceptibility in the cohort. To analyze this, we developed a method to account for differences in length of follow-up and known risk factors, such as age at radiation exposure, radiation dose, and gender. This analysis showed that the excess concordance of neoplasms could be explained by known risk factors, thereby suggesting that susceptibility factors did not play a role in the development of multiple tumors. Of the 350 thyroid cancers, 50 occurred in subjects with other radiation-related neoplasms. Therefore, we tested an additional hypothesis, that the presence of these other neoplasms was related to the clinical behavior of the thyroid cancer. Using thyroid cancer recurrence as the end point, we did not observe a relationship with the presence of other neoplasms. In summary, we demonstrated an excess of concordance of radiation-related neoplasms that could be explained by known risk factors, and we found that thyroid cancer behavior was not related to the occurrence of multiple tumors.",

Our retrospective study aimed to identify the diagnoses in a non-selected cohort of patients with altered liver tests and to investigate whether alpha-1 antitrypsin genotyping should be part of the diagnostic workup. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 501 patients who were admitted to our outpatient clinic for further evaluation of altered liver function tests were included in the study. The patients underwent a standardized diagnostic program with history taking, physical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasonography. Liver biopsy was performed if appropriate. RESULTS: More than 50\u200a% of the patients had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Alcoholic and drug-induced liver injury were found in 8.6\u200a% and 7\u200a% of patients, respectively. Chronic hepatitis B and C, autoimmune liver disease and inherited causes of liver disease made up for approximately 16\u200a% of the diagnoses. The remaining patients were diagnosed with kryptogenic liver disease or had miscellaneous diagnoses. In 3.7\u200a% of the genotyped patients, the alpha-1 antitrypsin genotype PiMZ was found. CONCLUSION: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is nowadays the most frequent cause of altered liver tests. Alcoholic liver disease might be underrepresented in our study since these patients less often seek medical attention or the diagnosis is already made by the primary care physician. Drug-induced liver injury was found in more patients than expected and might therefore be underdiagnosed in practice. The alpha-1 antitrypsin genotype PiMZ was found in absence of other possible causes of liver disease, indicating that the PiMZ genotype is itself a risk factor for liver disease. Genotyping for alpha-1 antitrypsin should therefore be done when other causes for altered liver function tests have been ruled out.",

Chronic pain following colon cancer surgery is still poorly understood, in particular the lack of a validated tool for measuring chronic pain is a major issue as such an instrument is critical for evaluating the incidence and risk factors. The CP score was created using data from Danish rectal cancer patients. METHODS: Danish colorectal cancer survivors diagnosed between 2001 and 2014 completed the CP score and two quality of life (QoL) measures. Clinical data were obtained from a national database. Convergent validity was investigated by testing the association of the CP score with a single ad hoc QoL item and the EORTC QLQ-C30, and discriminative validity was tested as the score's ability to differentiate between gender and age groups. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by determining the ability of the score to identify patients with a major impact of pain on QoL. RESULTS: Responses from 7127 colon cancer were included. Convergent validity was confirmed, as the score was associated with both QoL measures (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Moreover, the score could differentiate between males/females and older/younger patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively), reflecting high discriminative validity. Finally, the score was able to identify patients with a major impact on QoL, with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 82%. CONCLUSION: The CP score is a valid tool for measuring chronic pain after colon cancer surgery and should be used to homogenize outcomes in future studies.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Well designed studies show that COPD is the strongest risk factor for development of CAP. Lung microbiome, abnormal lung immunity and pathogen virulence are important components of the pathogenesis of CAP in COPD. The cause of CAP in patients with COPD is similar to that of non-COPD patients. However, patients with COPD are at an increased risk of infection by Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Empiric treatment regimens for CAP in COPD should contemplate the most common pathogens, and consideration should be given for the coverage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus depending on the severity of CAP, severity of COPD or prior isolation of these pathogens. COPD has not been consistently shown to be an independent risk factor for worse short-term outcomes in patients with CAP. In a long-term study, COPD is associated with worse outcomes in these patients. SUMMARY: Research focused on lung microbiome and abnormal lug immunity in patients with COPD should be prioritized. Further clinical research should try to consolidate the role of additional treatment approaches such as immunomodulating medications in COPD patients with CAP.",

Prior studies rely on qualitative assessment of shape, which limits reproducibility and clinical utility. Statistical shape analysis (SSA) allows for quantitative assessment of shape. We use this method to assess the shape of the LA and LAA and predict stroke in patients with AF. From a database of AF patients who had previously undergone MRI of the LA, we identified 43 patients with AF who subsequently had an ischemic stroke. We also identified a cohort of 201 controls with AF who did not have a stroke after the MRI. We performed SSA of the LA and LAA shape to quantify the shape of these structures. We found three of the candidate LAA shape parameters to be predictive of stroke, while none of the LA shape parameters predicted stroke. When the three predictive LAA shape parameters were added to a logistic regression model that included the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the area under the ROC curve increased from 0.640 to 0.778 (p\u2009=\u2009.003). The shape of the LA and LAA can be assessed quantitatively using SSA. LAA shape predicts stroke in AF patients, while LA shape does not. Additionally, LAA shape predicts stroke independent of CHA2DS2-VASc score. SSA for assessment of LAA shape may improve stroke risk stratification and clinical decision making for AF patients.",

To date, both the genetic etiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this disease remain poorly understood, although in recent years several studies have highlighted a number of genetic mutations causative for ALS. With these mutations pointing to potential pathways that may be affected within individuals with ALS, having the ability to generate human neurons and other disease relevant cells containing these mutations becomes even more critical if new therapies are to emerge. Recent developments with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing fields gave us the tools to introduce or correct a specific mutation at any site within the genome of an iPSC, and thus model the specific contribution of risk mutations. In this study we describe a rapid and efficient way to either introduce a mutation into a control line, or to correct an allele-specific mutation, generating an isogenic control line from patient-derived iPSCs with a given mutation. The mutations introduced were the G94A (also known as G93A) mutation into SOD1 or H517Q into FUS, and the mutation corrected was a patient iPSC line with I114T mutation in SOD1. A combination of small molecules and growth factors were used to guide a stepwise differentiation of the edited cells into motor neurons in order to demonstrate that disease-relevant cells could be generated for downstream applications. Through a combination of iPSCs and CRISPR editing, the cells generated here will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuron degeneration in ALS.",

A search was done in Medline and Ovid for articles with key words of open abdomen, temporary abdominal closure and staged abdominal repair. We found the use of the technique is justified in patients with trauma, abdominal compartment syndrome and patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis. The technique used for TAC must always be individualized for each clinical circumstance. The best reported results have been obtained with the vacuum pack technique.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Patients with liver cirrhosis are at increased risk for fungal infections. However, distinction of fungal colonisation (FC) and invasive mycoses is difficult. Aim of this study was to analyse the impact of FC on mortality of cirrhotic ICU-patients. METHODS: Retrospective mortality analysis of a prospectively maintained database on 120 cirrhotic patients with and without FC. Comparison to 120 noncirrhotic controls matched for APACHE-II (24.9 \u00b1 3.7 vs. 25.0 \u00b1 2.6; p = 0.263). RESULTS: About 69/120 (58%) of patients with cirrhosis had FC. These patients had significantly higher APACHE-II score and mortality compared to cirrhotic patients without FC (27 \u00b1 3 vs. 23 \u00b1 4, p < 0.001; 78 vs. 35%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, FC was independently (p = 0.047) associated to mortality. Mortality of noncirrhotic patients with FC (14/31; 45.2%) was not different to noncirrhotic controls without FC [28/89 (31.2%; p = 0.168)]. Similarly, in multivariate analysis of noncirrhotics, APACHE-II (p < 0.001), but not FC, was independently associated to mortality. Multiple regression analysis of all 240 cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients demonstrated that APACHE-II (p < 0.001), cirrhosis (p = 0.001) and FC (p = 0.049) were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Fungal \"colonisation\" is independently associated to mortality in cirrhotic ICU-patients. Early antimycotic therapy should be considered in critically ill cirrhotic patients with FC.",

We previously identified an oxidized derivative of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), in diet-induced steatohepatitic mice. Here, we investigated whether 7KC exacerbates psoriasis-like dermatitis by accelerating steatohepatitis in mice. A high-fat/high-cholesterol/high-sucrose/bile salt diet (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diet) with or without 0.0125% 7KC was fed to C57BL/6 mice (7KC or control group) for three weeks to induce steatohepatitis. A 5% imiquimod cream was then applied to the ears and dorsal skin for four days to induce psoriasis-like dermatitis. Hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration were exacerbated in the 7KC group compared with the control group after three weeks. Serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels were also elevated in the 7KC group (108.5 \u00b1 9.8 vs. 83.1 \u00b1 13.1 pg/mL, p < 0.005). Imiquimod cream increased the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score in mice in the 7KC group (9.14 \u00b1 0.75 vs. 5.17 \u00b1 1.17, p < 0.0001). Additionally, Tnfa, Il23a, Il17a, and Il22 mRNA levels in the dorsal lesion were significantly upregulated. Finally, Th17 cell differentiation and the TNF signaling pathway were enhanced in the dorsal lesions and liver of mice in the 7KC group.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: The number of patients aged > or =75 years who present with a stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increasing. Elderly patients often have significant comorbidity and may be unfit for surgery. Furthermore, surgery in the elderly is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in elderly patients. METHODS: Since 2003, 203 tumors in 193 patients aged > or =75 years were treated using SRT (118 T1 tumors, 85 T2 tumors). The median patient age was 79 years, 80% of patients were considered medically inoperable, and 20% of patients declined surgery. The median Charlson comorbidity score was 4, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Class III or greater) was present in 25% of patients. Risk-adapted SRT schemes were used with the same total dose of 60 grays in 3 fractions (33%), 5 fractions (50%), or 8 fractions (17% of patients), depending on the patient's risk for toxicity. RESULTS: SRT was well tolerated, and all but 1 patient completed treatment. Survival rates at 1 year and 3 years were 86% and 45%, respectively. Survival was correlated with performance score (P = .001) and pre-SRT lung function (P = .04). The actuarial local control rate at 3 years was 89%. Acute toxicity was uncommon, and late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade > or =3 toxicity was observed in <10% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: SRT achieved high local control rates with minimal toxicity in patients aged > or =75 years despite their significant medical comorbidities. These results indicated that more active diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are justified in elderly patients and that SRT should be considered and discussed as a curative treatment alternative.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses show strong evidence of associations among genetic variants in CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25, smoking quantity, and lung cancer. This meta-analysis tests whether the CHRNA5 variant rs16969968 predicts age of smoking cessation and age of lung cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Meta-analyses examined associations between rs16969968, age of quitting smoking, and age of lung cancer diagnosis in 24 studies of European ancestry (n = 29 072). In each dataset, we used Cox regression models to evaluate the association between rs16969968 and the two primary phenotypes (age of smoking cessation among ever smokers and age of lung cancer diagnosis among lung cancer case patients) and the secondary phenotype of smoking duration. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed with the Cochran Q test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The rs16969968 allele (A) was associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 0.98, P = .0042), and the AA genotype was associated with a four-year delay in median age of quitting compared with the GG genotype. Among smokers with lung cancer diagnoses, the rs16969968 genotype (AA) was associated with a four-year earlier median age of diagnosis compared with the low-risk genotype (GG) (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.12, P = 1.1*10(-5)). CONCLUSION: These data support the clinical significance of the CHRNA5 variant rs16969968. It predicts delayed smoking cessation and an earlier age of lung cancer diagnosis in this meta-analysis. Given the existing evidence that this CHRNA5 variant predicts favorable response to cessation pharmacotherapy, these findings underscore the potential clinical and public health importance of rs16969968 in CHRNA5 in relation to smoking cessation success and lung cancer risk.",

Ten studies, encompassing 783 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between the two groups in the long-term kyphosis angle (mean difference [MD] = -2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.66 to -0.61; p = 0.01), the anterior height of the vertebral body (MD = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.40 to 5.94; p = 0.002), and the cement leakage rates (risk ratio [RR] = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.95; p = 0.02). However, there were no significant differences in the short-term visual analog scale (VAS) scores (MD = -0.57, 95% CI -1.33 to 0.20; p = 0.15), the long-term VAS scores (MD = -0.99, 95% CI = -2.29 to 0.31; p = 0.14), the short-term Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores (MD = -6.54, 95% CI = -14.57 to 1.48; p = 0.11), the long-term ODI scores (MD=-2.01, 95% CI = -11.75 to 7.73; p = 0.69), the operation time (MD = 4.47, 95% CI = -0.22 to 9.17; p = 0.06), the short-term kyphosis angle (MD = -2.25, 95% CI = -5.14 to 0.65; p = 0.13), or the adjacent-level fracture rates (RR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.76 to 3.03; p = 0.24). This meta-analysis demonstrates that KP and VP are both safe and effective surgical procedures for treating OVCF. Compared with VP, KP can significantly relieve a long-term kyphosis angle, improve the height of the vertebral body, and reduce the incidence of bone cement leakage. However, because of the limitations of this meta-analysis, a large randomized controlled trial is required to confirm our findings.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To study the interplay between several indicators of social disadvantage and hospitalisations due to ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSC) in 2011\u25002013. To evaluate whether the accumulation of preceding social disadvantage in one point of time or prolongation of social disadvantage had an effect on hospitalisations due to ACSCs. Four common indicators of disadvantage are examined: living alone, low level of education, poverty and unemployment. DESIGN: A population-based register study. SETTING: Nationwide individual-level register data on hospitalisations due to ACSCs for the years 2011-2013 and preceding data on social and socioeconomic factors for the years 2006\u25002010. PARTICIPANTS: Finnish residents aged 45 or older on 1 January 2011. OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalisations due to ACSCs in 2011-2013. The effect of accumulation of preceding disadvantage in one point of time and its prolongation on ACSCs was studied using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: People with preceding cumulative social disadvantage were more likely to be hospitalised due to ACSCs. The most hazardous combination was simultaneously living alone, low level of education and poverty among the middle-aged individuals (aged 45-64 years) and the elderly (over 64 years). Risk ratio (RR) of being hospitalised due to ACSC was 3.16 (95% CI 3.03-3.29) among middle-aged men and 3.54 (3.36-3.73) among middle-aged women compared with individuals without any of these risk factors when controlling for age and residential area. For the elderly, the RR was 1.61 (1.57-1.66) among men and 1.69 (1.64-1.74) among women. CONCLUSIONS: To improve social equity in healthcare, it is important to recognise not only patients with cumulative disadvantage but also-as this study shows-patients with particular combinations of disadvantage who may be more susceptible. The identification of these vulnerable patient groups is also necessary to reduce the use of more expensive treatment in specialised healthcare.",

METHODS: Increased CVD risk patients and their family members/partners were invited to attend a 16-week programme consisting of a professional multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention, with appropriate risk factor and therapeutic management in a community setting. Smoking, dietary habits, physical activity levels, waist circumference and body mass index, and medical risk factors were measured at initial assessment, at end of programme, and at 1-year follow up. RESULTS: Adherence to the programme was high, with 375 (87.2%) participants and 181 (84.6%) partners having completed the programme, with 1-year data being obtained from 235 (93.6%) patients and 107 (90.7%) partners. There were statistically significant improvements in both lifestyle (body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, Mediterranean diet score, fish, fruit, and vegetable consumption, smoking cessation rates), psychosocial (anxiety and depression scales and quality of life indices), and medical risk factors (blood pressure, lipid and glycaemic targets) between baseline and end of programme, with these improvements being sustained at 1-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate how a holistic model of CVD prevention can improve cardiovascular risk factors by achieving healthier lifestyles and optimal medical management.",

Management of a first AF episode is different depending on the clinical status of patients. Practice guidelines developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society are available for the management of these patients. A four-step decisional scheme must be followed in the management of a first recent AF episode: need for a short- and long-term anticoagulation, define a rythmologic strategy (rhythm or rate control), select the weapon (drug, device or ablation) and reconsider the strategy if needed. After a first uncomplicated paroxysmal AF episode, guidelines recommend that prescription of antiarrhythmics must be avoided and anticoagulation is optional. After a first persistent AF episode, guidelines recommend to either respect or reduce the arrhythmia. Prescription of antiarrhythmics and anticoagulation is also optional depending on the patients condition. In case of the AF reduction decision, anticoagulation must be tailored preliminary to this reduction. AF recurrence rate varies depending on the patients condition, and the risk of stroke assessed by the CHADS(2) score might be similarly considered for both paroxysmal and persistent AF.",

Although no comparative trials of these treatments have been performed, published data and clinical experience suggest comparable effectiveness. In VNS, DBS and RNS seizure reduction is delayed and increases over time raising the question of anti-epileptogenic mechanisms of neuromodulation. Considering the long-term effectiveness assumed for neuromodulatory treatments and the chronic nature of drug-resistant epilepsy, study designs allowing for long-term comparative observations would be of great value, but are hindered by the inherent nature of a long-term [surgical] control group and the bias associated with open-label trials.

The purposes of our study were to define the clinical characteristics of foreign body aspiration in the pediatric population and to evaluate the significance of delay in its diagnosis and treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study used a retrospective review of 136 charts of children up to the age of 16 who underwent bronchoscopy for foreign body removal for 10 years in Ha'Emek Medical Center (Afula, Israel). An adult witness of an aspiration episode (most frequent presenting symptom), a child younger than 2 years, and an abnormal plain chest radiography were found to be significant predictors of foreign body aspiration. Estimated risk for foreign body aspiration was significantly higher in children who were younger than 2 years with an eyewitness for the aspiration episode and abnormal chest radiography (odds ratio, 5.6, with confidence interval from 2.0 to 15.6). The rate of complication was 2-fold higher in patients who arrived at the hospital 2 days or more after the aspiration compared with patients who arrived earlier. The rate of complication was 2-fold higher in patients who underwent bronchoscopy 24 hours or more after arrival at the emergency department compared with patients who underwent bronchoscopy within the first 24 hours.

METHODS: This retrospective study compares data obtained from two centres, with a total study population of 655 (n\u2009=\u2009393 cemented, n\u2009=\u2009262 uncemented). Patients were matched at baseline for gender, age, surgery side, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index and pre-operative haemoglobin level. Outcome measurements were prosthesis-related complications, pre- and post-operative, with reoperation rate and mortality and other complications after 1\u00a0year, surgery time, blood loss and immobility at discharge. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mortality after 1\u00a0year, total other complications, immobility at the time of discharge and total prosthesis-related complications between both groups. Significantly more periprosthetic fractures and post-operative infections were seen in the uncemented group with significantly more reoperations compared to the cemented group. Significant differences were seen in cardiovascular complications, blood loss and surgery time in favour of the uncemented group. CONCLUSIONS: In consequence of the significant higher prosthesis-related complications (e.g. infections, periprosthetic fractures and reoperations) in the uncemented group in this study, we recommend cemented hemiarthroplasty in patients with a femoral neck fracture.

However, we recently reported no influence of T2DM on CC prognosis, suggesting that any effect might be at the early stages of tumor development. We hypothesized that T2DM may create an environment in the healthy tissue, which acts as a carcinogenesis driver in agreement with the field of cancerization concept. Here, we focused on early carcinogenesis by analyzing paired tumor and normal colonic mucosa samples from the same patients. The proteome of CC and paired mucosa was quantitatively analyzed in 28 individuals (12 diabetics and 16 nondiabetics) by mass spectrometry with isobaric labeling. Out of 3076 identified proteins, 425 were differentially expressed at the tumor in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. In the adjacent mucosa, 143 proteins were differentially expressed in diabetics and nondiabetics. An enrichment analysis of this signature pointed to mitochondria, ribosome, and translation. Only six proteins were upregulated by diabetes both in tumor and mucosa, of which five were mitochondrial proteins. Differential expression in diabetic versus nondiabetic mucosa was confirmed for MRPL53, MRPL18, and TIMM8B. Higher levels of MRPL18, TIMM8B, and EIF1A were also found in normal colon epithelial cells exposed to high-glucose conditions. We conclude that T2DM is associated with specific molecular changes in the normal mucosa of CC patients, consistent with field of cancerization in a diabetic environment. The mitochondrial protein signature identifies a potential therapeutic target that could underlie the higher risk of CC in diabetics.",

        "a": "Participation in regular exercise of moderate intensity is associated with a plethora of systemic benefits, including a reduction in risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis; however, intensive exercise may paradoxically culminate in sudden cardiac arrest among individuals harboring arrhythmogenic substrates. The precise mechanism for arrhythmogenesis is likely multifactorial, however, surges in catecholamines, electrolyte shifts, acid-base disturbances, increased core temperature and demand myocardial ischemia are potential contributors. Although most deaths occur in middle aged and older males with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, a significant proportion also affect young athletes with inherited or congenital cardiac abnormalities. The impact of such catastrophes on society, particularly when a young high-profile athlete is affected could be considered a justified reason for identifying individuals who may be at risk. Given the rarity of deaths in young athletes, only the simplest screening test, such as the 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) may be considered to be cost effective. The ECG is effective for detecting serious electrical diseases in young athletes such as congenital electrical accessory pathways and ion channel diseases but can also identify athletes with potential life-threatening structural diseases such as hypertrophic and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. One of the concerns about ECG screening is that regular intensive exercise results in several physiological alterations in cardiac structure and function that are reflected on the athlete's ECG. Sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, incomplete right bundle branch block, minor J-point elevation and large QRS voltages are common. Conversely, some repolarization anomalies affecting the ST segment, T waves and QT interval may overlap with patterns observed in patients with serious cardiac diseases. The situation is complicated further because age, sex and ethnicity of the athletes also influence the ECG and there is a risk that erroneous interpretation could have serious consequences. This review will describe the normal electrical patterns of the \"athlete's heart\" and provide insights into differentiation physiological electrical patterns from those observed in serious cardiac disease.",

Qualitative disorders which cannot be measured are differentiated from quantitative disorders. Self-assessment of olfactory function is rather poor therefore olfactory testing is mandatory in cases of patients complaining about an olfactory disorder. Olfactory screening smell tests are available for orientation, however, for detailed testing or in cases of a pathological screening test an extensive psychophysical olfactory test battery such as the Sniffin' Sticks Test battery should be used. According to the result of the test battery olfactory function can be qualified as norm, hyp- or anosmic. Additionally, in cases of medicolegal questions, olfactory evoked potentials can be recorded. Smell disorders are classified according to the history, clinical and endoscopic examination of the nose. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computertomography may contribute to classify the disorder. Sinunasal olfactory disorders are considered to be the most common ones. If the etiology remains unclear a neurological examination has to be performed in order to rule out a concomitant neurodegenerative disease. Olfactory disorders in the elderly might have to be considered as a sign of a reduced regeneration capacity in general being depicted in an increase in overall mortality in affected subjects.",

        "a": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As HIV treatment programmes scale up to meet the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, care must be taken to start antiretroviral treatment safely in patients with advanced disease (CD4 counts <200\u200acells/\u03bcl) who are simultaneously at risk for opportunistic infections and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Invasive fungal diseases pose a great threat at this critical time point, though the development of inexpensive and highly accurate rapid diagnostic tests has changed the approach HIV programmes are taking to reduce the high mortality associated with these opportunistic infections. This article summarizes recent advances and findings in fungal opportunistic infection diagnostics with a focus on screening to prevent cryptococcal meningitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening using a lateral flow assay platform is cost-effective and feasible to implement as either a laboratory reflex or point-of-care test. Recent CrAg screening pilots have elucidated the varying prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia across geographic regions, which may aid programme planning. Evidence from recently completed clinical trials provides a strong motivation for the use of CrAg titer to refine treatment options for patients with subclinical cryptococcal disease. SUMMARY: Although several operational barriers to programme effectiveness still need to be addressed, the utility of CrAg screening using inexpensive and accurate antigen assays has been demonstrated in real-world HIV programmes, paving the way for development and testing of other fungal opportunistic infection screening strategies and for an integrated advanced HIV disease testing package to reduce AIDS mortality and ensure safe antiretroviral treatment initiation.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Choledocholithiasis is the most common indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Identifying risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is important for reducing the risk of developing PEP after common bile duct (CBD) stone removal. However, studies examining the risk factors for PEP for CBD stones are scarce. The aim of this study was to examine whether the presence or absence of acute cholangitis is a clinical risk factor for PEP in patients with CBD stones. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 1539 patients with na\u00efve papillae were divided into patients without and with acute cholangitis. We compared the incidence of PEP between the two groups using one-to-one propensity score matching to adjust for the potential confounding factors of PEP. RESULTS: In the entire cohort, the rates of PEP in patients without and with acute cholangitis were 9.6% (52/542) and 1.8% (18/997), respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a05.8). In the propensity-matched cohort, the rates of PEP in patients without and with acute cholangitis were 8.3% (27/326) and 2.5% (8/326), respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.6). The rate of PEP was significantly higher in patients without acute cholangitis than in those with acute cholangitis after adjusting for the confounding factors of PEP. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of acute cholangitis may be an important clinical risk factor for PEP due to CBD stone removal. In patients without acute cholangitis, endoscopists should explain the specific risk of PEP carefully and actively implement prophylaxis against PEP.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy added to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke has been largely demonstrated. However, evidence of the economic incentive of this strategy is still limited, especially in the context of a randomized controlled trial. We aimed to analyze whether mechanical thrombectomy combined with IVT (IVMT) is cost-effective when compared with IVT alone. METHODS: Individual-level cost and outcome data were collected in the THRACE randomized controlled trial (Thrombectomie des Art\u00e8res Cer\u00e9brales) including patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients were assigned to receive IVT or IVMT. The primary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale score of functional independence at 90 days (score 0-2) and the EuroQol-5D quality-of-life score at 1 year. RESULTS: Treating acute ischemic stroke with IVMT (n=200) versus IVT (n=202) increased the rate of functional independence by 10.9% (53.0% versus 42.1%; P=0.028), at an increased cost of $2116 (\u20ac1909), with no significant difference in mortality (12% versus 13%; P=0.70) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (2% versus 2%; P=0.71). The cost per one averted case of disability was estimated at $19 379 (\u20ac17 480). The incremental cost per one quality-adjusted life year gained was $14 881 (\u20ac13 423). On sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-effectiveness with IVMT was 84.1% in terms of cases of averted disability and 92.2% in terms of quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on randomized trial data, this study demonstrates that IVMT used to treat acute ischemic stroke is cost-effective when compared with IVT alone.

We therefore analyzed which commonly available laboratory and clinical parameters may help improve the prognostication in this patient group. This retrospective monocenter analysis includes 128 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN treated with cetuximab alone or in combination with polychemotherapy as first line therapy. Factors with independent prognostic power in the multivariate analysis were used to build up a score separating patient groups with different survival. Patients had a median age of 61 years and 103 patients were treated with polychemotherapy plus cetuximab. An ECOG score above 1, high CRP and leukocyte levels, less intensive treatment and a time below 12 months from primary diagnosis to relapse remained as independent negative prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Patients with 0 to 1 risk factors had a median OS of 13.6 months compared to a median OS of less than one month for patients 4 to 5 risk factors (p<0.001). This study identifies 5 clinical and serum values that influence survival of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN treated with cetuximab. By combining these factors to create a score for OS, it is possible to distinguish a group of patients with significantly improved survival and define those most likely to have no benefit from cetuximab treatment.",

        "a": "UNLABELLED: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality and morbidity in the United States. Healthcare providers can contribute significantly to the war against tobacco use; patients advised to quit smoking by their physicians are 1.6 times more likely to quit than patients not receiving physician advice. However, most smokers do not receive this advice when visiting their physicians. The Morehouse School of Medicine Tobacco Control Research Program was undertaken to develop best practices for implementing the \"2000 Public Health Services Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence\" and the \"Pathways to Freedom\" tobacco cessation program among African American physicians in private practice and healthcare providers at community health centers. Ten focus groups were conducted; 82 healthcare professionals participated. Six major themes were identified as barriers to the provision of smoking cessation services. An intervention was developed based on these results and tested among Georgia community-based physicians. A total of 308 charts were abstracted both pre- and post-intervention. Charts were scored using a system awarding one point for each of the five \"A's\" recommended by the PHS guidelines (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) employed during the patient visit. The mean pre-intervention five \"A's\" score was 1.29 compared to 1.90 post-intervention (P < 0.001). All charts had evidence of the first \"A\" (\"asked\") both pre- and post-intervention, and the other four \"A's\" all had statistically significant increases pre-to post-intervention.

Two of the most common techniques incorporate onlay and inlay fixation methods, which can be done arthroscopically or open and in a variety of anatomic locations. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the clinical outcomes between onlay versus inlay humeral fixation for biceps tenodesis for long head of the biceps tendon pathology. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Only studies reporting outcomes and complications after onlay and inlay biceps tenodeses were included. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 418 patients (252 onlay, 166 inlay) with a mean age of 56.84 years were included. Visual analog pain scale scores, Constant score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score did not differ. \"Popeye\" deformity was found in 17 patients (7.80%) in the onlay group and in 15 patients (11.28%) in the inlay group (odds ratio, 0.28; P = 0.07). No difference in postoperative cramping or failure rates was found. CONCLUSION: Both onlay and inlay biceps tenodeses result in improved clinical outcomes and are at low risk of Popeye deformities, with no statistically significant differences between either method.

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: The study sought to evaluate the feasibility of using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic features for automated identification of reports about patient safety incidents by type and severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier ensembles were trained and validated using balanced datasets of critical incident report texts (n_type\u2009=\u20092860, n_severity\u2009=\u20091160) collected from a state-wide reporting system. Generalizability was evaluated on different and independent hospital-level reporting system. Concepts were extracted from report narratives using the UMLS Metathesaurus, and their relevance and frequency were used as semantic features. Performance was evaluated by F-score, Hamming loss, and exact match score and was compared with SVM ensembles using bag-of-words (BOW) features on 3 testing datasets (type/severity: n_benchmark\u2009=\u2009286/116, n_original\u2009=\u2009444/4837, n_independent =6000/5950). RESULTS: SVMs using semantic features met or outperformed those based on BOW features to identify 10 different incident types (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark\u2009=\u200982.6%/69.4%; original\u2009=\u200977.9%/68.8%; independent\u2009=\u200978.0%/67.4%) and extreme-risk events (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark\u2009=\u200987.3%/87.3%; original\u2009=\u200925.5%/19.8%; independent\u2009=\u200949.6%/52.7%). For incident type, the exact match score for semantic classifiers was consistently higher than BOW across all test datasets (exact match [semantics/BOW]: benchmark\u2009=\u200948.9%/39.9%; original\u2009=\u200957.9%/44.4%; independent\u2009=\u200959.5%/34.9%). DISCUSSION: BOW representations are not ideal for the automated identification of incident reports because they do not account for text semantics. UMLS semantic representations are likely to better capture information in report narratives, and thus may explain their superior performance. CONCLUSIONS: UMLS-based semantic classifiers were effective in identifying incidents by type and extreme-risk events, providing better generalizability than classifiers using BOW.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Fast-track recovery after coronary artery bypass surgery has influenced patient care positively. Predicting patients who fall off track and require prolonged (> or =7 days) hospitalization remains uncertain. The Parsonnet risk assessment score is effective in predicting length of stay, but is limited by inaccurate subdivision of risk categories. We simplified the Parsonnet risk scale to better identify patients eligible for fast-track recovery. METHOD: The cases of 604 consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were reviewed retrospectively. A rapid recovery protocol emphasizing reduced CPB time, preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) criteria, and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis was applied to all patients. The five original divisions of the Parsonnet risk scale were reduced to three risk categories: Low (0-10; Group A), Intermediate (11-20; Group B), High (> 20; Group C). Comparisons of progressive risk categories were analyzed to identify predictive factors associated with fast-track outcomes. RESULTS: The thirty-day operative mortality for the entire group was 3.6%. Three clinical features were identified that distinguished risk progression-female gender, reoperative CABG, and increased age. Additionally, the presence of diabetes (p < 0.05), congestive heart failure (p < 0.01), and peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.001) distinguished Groups A and B, while acute myocardial infarction (p < 0.05) influenced outcomes in Group C. Group A (48%) mean risk score 5.9+/-3.2 was compared to Group B (34%) 14.8+/-2.6, which was further compared to Group C (18%) 26.4+/-2.8. The mean length of stay for Group A (5.3+/-4.1 days) was notably less than Group B (6.1+/-4.7 days; p < 0.05); however, both groups responded favorably to fast-track techniques. Group C did not respond comparably (9.2+/-9.2 vs 6.1+/-4.7 days; p < 0.001) and experienced prolonged recovery. The simplified Parsonnet risk scale did not identify differences in operative mortality and revealed only pneumonia (p < 0.05) and atrial fibrillation (p < 0.01) to be greater in Group C. As risk increased, significantly less revascularization was performed (Group A 3.6+/-1.2 grafts/patient vs Group B 3.3+/-1.2 [p < 0.01]; Group B 3.3+/-1.2 vs Group C 2.5+/-1.0 [p < 0.001]). CONCLUSION: A simplified Parsonnet risk scale (three categories) is an effective tool in identifying factors limiting fast-track recovery. Low- and intermediate-risk patients represent the majority (82%) and respond well to fast-track methods. High-risk patients (18%) are limited by a greater percentage of female patients, reoperative CABG, and the very elderly, resulting in fast-track failure. Strategies to improve recovery in high-risk patients may include evolving off-pump techniques.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Women are generally underrepresented in trials focusing on aortic aneurysm. Nevertheless, sex-related differences have recently emerged from several studies and registries. The aim of this research was to assess whether sex-related anatomical disparities existed in fenestrated and branched aortic repair candidates and whether these discrepancies could influence endovascular repair outcomes. METHODS: Data from all consecutive patients treated during the 2008-2019 period within the Italian Multicenter fenestrated or branched endovascular aortic repair (F/BEVAR) Registry were included in the present study. Propensity matching was performed using a logistic regression model adjusted for demographic data and comorbidities to obtain comparable male and female samples. The selection model led to a final study population of 176 patients (88 women and 88 men) among the total initial cohort of 596. Study endpoints were technical and clinical success, overall survival, aneurysm-related death, and reintervention rates evaluated at 30 days and during follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (15.9%) received urgent/emergent repair. In most of the cases (71.6%), women received treatment for extensive thoracoabdominal pathology (Crawford type I, II, or III aneurysm rather than type IV or juxta-pararenal) versus 46.6% of men (p=0.001). Female patients presented with more challenging iliac accesses with at least one side considered hostile in 27.3% of the cases (vs 13.6% in male patients, p=0.039). Finally, women had significantly smaller visceral vessels. Women had significantly worse operative outcomes, with an 86.2% technical success rate versus 96.6% in the male population (p=0.016). No differences were recorded in terms of 30-day reinterventions between men and women. The 5-year estimate of freedom from late reintervention, according to Kaplan-Meier analysis, was 85.6% in men versus 81.6% in women (p=ns). No aneurysm-related death was recorded during follow-up (median observational time, 23 months [interquartile range, 7-45 months]). CONCLUSION: Women presented a significantly higher incidence of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, smaller visceral vessels, and more complex iliofemoral accesses, resulting in a significantly lower technical success after F/BEVAR. Further studies assessing sex-related differences are needed to properly determine the impact on outcomes and stratify procedural risks. CLINICAL IMPACT: Women are generally underrepresented in trials focusing on aortic aneurysms. Aiming to assess whether sex may affect outcomes after a complex endovascular aortic repair, a propensity score selection was applied to a total population of 596 patients receiving F/BEVAR aortic repair with the Cook platform, matching each treated female patient with a corresponding male patient. Women presented more frequently a thoracoabdominal aneurysm extent, smaller visceral vessels, and complex iliofemoral accesses, resulting in significantly worse operative outcomes, with an 86.2% technical success versus 96.6% (p=0.016). No differences were recorded in terms of short-term and mid-term reinterventions. According to these results, careful and critical assessment should be posed in case of female patients receiving complex aortic repair, especially regarding preoperative anatomical evaluation and clinical selection with appropriate surgical risk stratification.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hemorrhage remains a leading cause of preventable death in tactical and combat settings. Alternate routes of delivery of tranexamic acid (TXA), an adjunct in the management of hemorrhagic shock, are being studied. A working group for the Committee for Tactical Emergency Casualty Care reviewed the available evidence on the potential role for intramuscular (IM) administration of TXA in nonhospital settings as soon as possible from the point of injury. METHODS: EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed databases were sequentially searched by medical librarians for evidence of TXA use in the following contexts and/or using the following keywords: prehospital, trauma, hemorrhagic shock, optimal timing, optimal dose, safe volume, incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), IM bioavailability. RESULTS: A total of 183 studies were reviewed. The strength of the available data was variable, generally weak in quality, and included laboratory research, case reports, retrospective observational reviews, and few prospective studies. Current volume and concentrations of available formulations of TXA make it, in theory, amenable to IM injection. Current bestpractice guidelines for large-volume injection (i.e., 5mL) support IM administration in four locations in the adult human body. One case series suggests complete bioavailability of IM TXA in healthy patients. Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of IM TXA in hemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSION: There is currently insufficient evidence to support a strong recommendation for or against IM administration of TXA in the combat setting; however, there is an abundance of literature demonstrating efficacy and safety of TXA use in a broad range of patient populations. Balancing the available data and risk- benefit ratio, IM TXA should be considered a viable treatment option for tactical and combat applications. Additional studies should focus on the optimal dose and bioavailability of IM dosing of patients in hemorrhagic shock, with assessment of potential downstream sequelae.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: affective temperaments have been so far understudied in the field of obesity. Therefore, we aimed to assess affective temperaments in outpatients with obesity reporting symptoms of binge eating (BE) and multiple weight cycling (MWC) and to investigate the likelihood of an association between affective temperaments and risk of both conditions. METHODS: A total of 300 individuals with obesity seeking treatment at the Obesity Unit of an academic hospital were asked to complete self-report measures of affective temperaments, BE, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. RESULTS: Even in the absence of full-blown mental disorders, symptoms of anxiety and depression emerged in the sample; 197 individuals (65.6%) reported BE and 162 (54%) MWC. The most frequent affective temperament was the depressive one. Depression symptoms and cyclothymic scores (directly), and age and hyperthymic score (inversely) were significantly associated with BE risk, while being an active smoker (directly) and hyperthymic score (inversely) were significantly associated with MWC risk, after controlling for confounders in a multiple logistic regression. LIMITATIONS: sample size was small, the study was limited to a single center, no formal definition of weight cycling exists and MWC was self-reported. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of outpatients with obesity reported BE and MWC notwithstanding the absence of a formal psychiatric diagnosis. Cyclothymic scores were positively associated with BE while the hyperthymic temperament showed a protective effect on both BE and MWC. These findings suggest the need for multidisciplinary treatments for people with obesity enhancing research on temperament-based psychological interventions.",

        "a": "The enlargement of ventricular volume is a general trend in the elderly, especially in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple susceptibility loci have been reported to have an increased risk for AD and the morphology of brain structures are affected by the variations in the risk loci. Therefore, we hypothesized that genes contributed significantly to the ventricular surface, and the changes of ventricular surface were associated with the impairment of cognitive functions. After the quality controls (QC) and genotyping, a lateral ventricular segmentation method was employed to obtain the surface features of lateral ventricle. We evaluated the influence of 18 selected AD susceptibility loci on both volume and surface morphology across 410 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Correlations were conducted between radial distance (RD) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscales. Only the C allele at the rs744373 loci in BIN1 gene significantly accelerated the atrophy of lateral ventricle, including the anterior horn, body, and temporal horn of left lateral ventricle. No significant effect on lateral ventricle was found at other loci. Our results revealed that most regions of the bilateral ventricular surface were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive scores, particularly in delayed recall. Besides, small areas of surface were negatively correlated with language, orientation, and visuospatial scores. Together, our results indicated that the genetic variation affected the localized areas of lateral ventricular surface, and supported that lateral ventricle was an important brain structure associated with cognition in the elderly.",

In 163 patients with malnutrition [mild in 33 (19.6%), moderate in 69 (42.9%), severe in 61 (37.4%)] treated in the ICU, changes in the concentration of selected proteins [interleukin (IL)-1Ra, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1), IL-6, IL-10, sTLR4, MyD88, A20, HSP70, HMGB1] were examined. In the whole group of malnourished patients, median values of sTNFR1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, TLR4, IL-1Ra were significantly increased, while the levels of MyD88 and A20 proteins were significantly reduced (in comparison to the well-nourished healthy group). Only the sTNFR1 protein showed a significant difference between mild, moderate and severe malnutrition, and increased concentrations as the severity of malnutrition increased (the correlation study found that as the degree of malnutrition increased, the sTNFR1 concentrations increased; p = 0.0000, R = 0.5442). It was observed that death was significantly more frequent in the group of patients who on the first day of hospitalization in the ICU scored 5 or more points on the NRS 2002 scale (p = 0.0004). In the patients who died significantly higher concentrations of sTNFR1, IL-6, IL-10, HSP70 were observed in comparison to the patients who survived. The present results are encouraging and indicate the desirability of undertaking multicentre clinical trials including monitoring of sTNFR1 in assessing the severity of malnutrition and immune disorders in the first hours after admission to the ICU, because it can be assumed that without early diagnosis of innate immunity disorders any attempts at their modulation may be ineffective.",

        "a": "Background: A common contributory factor to falls is the use of medicines, especially those commonly known as \u201cfall-risk increasing drugs\u201d (FRIDs). The use of FRIDs is common among older people (OP). However, OP and their family caregivers (FCGs) are largely unaware of FRIDs and their risks in increasing the risk of falls (ROF). Methods: A booklet which aims to provide information on topics related to FRIDs was developed. The booklet was reviewed by a panel of 14 reviewers, and the content validity index (CVI) for each subsection of the booklet was computed. Pilot testing of the booklet utilized a pre-post intervention study design and included 50 OP and 50 FCGs as study participants. Perceived knowledge of the participants was assessed prior to and after completing the booklet. Participants\u2019 opinions on the usefulness and usability of the booklet were also obtained. Results: The booklet contained eight sections and each subsection of the booklet had a CVI ranging from 0.93 to 1.00. Completing the booklet resulted in improved perceived knowledge scores for each perceived knowledge item among both the OP and FCG groups (all items: p-value < 0.001). The participants perceived the booklet as useful and usable, as evidenced by almost all the perceived usefulness and usability items having a score of over 4.0. Conclusions: The FRIDs booklet developed in this study had good content validity and was widely accepted by the OP and FCGs. The positive effect on the participants\u2019 knowledge of topics related to FRIDs means that the booklet could be useful as a patient education tool to enhance FRIDs knowledge and awareness among OP and FCGs.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare the performance of different proposed diagnostic pathways in a cohort of biopsy-na\u00efve men at risk for prostate cancer (PCa), in terms of biopsy avoidance, accurate diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), and reduction in overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer (cisPCa), with particular focus on a recently suggested \"risk-based\" MRI-directed diagnostic pathway. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study, including 499 biopsy-na\u00efve men at risk for PCa. All men underwent PI-RADS-compliant prostate MRI, transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided targeted (TBx), and systematic biopsy (SBx). Five diagnostic pathways were retrospectively evaluated and compared for. Outcome measures were biopsy avoidance, combined with missed csPCa and detected cisPCa. csPCa and cisPCa were defined as ISUP grade group\u2009\u2265\u20092 and grade\u2009=\u20091, respectively. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Decision curve analyses were used to compare the benefits of the pathways across a range of biopsy thresholds. RESULTS: The prevalence (detection-focused [reference] pathway) of csPCa and cisPCa was 52.9% (264/499) and 23.0% (115/499). MRI-focused pathway (no biopsy in PI-RADS 1-2 men) did not significantly reduce ISUP\u2009\u2265\u20092 cancer detection (52.1% (260/499); p\u2009=\u20090.13), but significantly reduced ISUP 1 cancers diagnosed (20.6% (103/499); p\u2009<\u20090.01), and biopsy avoidance was 11.8% (59/499). The risk-based MRI-directed pathway (no biopsy in low-risk PI-RADS 1-3 men) resulted in a small reduction of ISUP\u2009\u2265\u20092 diagnosed (51.7% (258/499); p\u2009=\u20090.04), however non-significant when compared to MRI-focused pathway (p\u2009=\u20090.625). Moreover, the risk-based pathway further reduced detection of ISUP 1 (18.6% (93/499); p\u2009<\u20090.01), and biopsy avoidance was 19.2% (96/499). Decision curve analysis showed maximized net benefit of the risk-based pathway, for the range of threshold probabilities between 6.25 and 65%. CONCLUSION: The risk-based MRI-directed pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis was optimal in balancing accurate diagnosis, reducing overdiagnosis, and maximizing biopsy avoidance. This substantial evidence should inform guideline recommendations towards using \"risk-based\" MRI-directed biopsy decisions in biopsy-na\u00efve men at risk of significant prostate cancer. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Our study recognizes the added value of prostate MRI and MR-targeted biopsies in order to propose clinical diagnostic pathways for prostate cancer, towards maximizing the potential avoidance of unnecessary biopsies, while maintaining optimal detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer. \u2022 The risk-based MRI-directed pathway incorporates risk factors such as PSA density, digital rectal examination, and family history to further refine the initial stratification of patients based on PI-RADS scores. \u2022 In this study, the risk-based pathway had the most optimal performance in terms of combination of outcomes, with the highest rate of biopsy avoidance (19.2%), while keeping a high detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (51.7%), when compared to the reference standard (52.9%).",

        "a": "UNLABELLED: Several studies have shown an association between exposure to statins and favorable clinical outcomes for various types of infections. We aimed to assess the impact of statin use on mortality, disease severity and complications among hospitalized patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Data were analyzed from a retrospectively collected database of 499 patients diagnosed with CDI during 2009-2014. We compared infection outcomes between 178 statin (36 %) users and 321 (64 %) non-users. On multivariate analysis, we found that statin use did not have a significant impact on 30-day mortality (OR\u2009=\u20091.54; 95 % CI, 0.85-2.79; p\u2009=\u20090.15) or any significant effect on CDI severity and complication. Concomitant statin use has no significant impact on short-term mortality or effect on CDI severity and complications among hospitalized patients with CDI. However, patients in the statin group were older and had higher Charlson score compared with the non-statin group. Whether these factors affected a possible impact of statins on the disease course remains to be investigated. KEY MESSAGES: \u2022 Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea among hospitalized adult patients in the developed countries. \u2022 There is an increasing morbidity and mortality of CDI patients due to the emergence of new strains of high virulence. \u2022 Recent studies demonstrated that prior statin use has protective and ameliorating effects on morbidity and mortality among CDI patients. \u2022 Our study showed that concomitant statin use has no significant impact on short-term mortality, CDI severity and its complications.",

The study objective was to investigate the relationships between vitamin D (vitD), vitamin K1 (vitK1), and calcium intake with bone mineral density (BMD) and vitamin D status in an ambulatory population with DM and CKD. METHODS: Adults (age 18-80 years; n\u2009=\u200962) with DM and CKD (stages 1-4) were recruited from the Northern Alberta Renal Program. Primary outcome variables included vitD, vitK1, and calcium intake; serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D; and BMD as measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: With the increase in people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and expanding eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is intense interest in the use of novel delivery models that allow understaffed health systems to successfully deal with an increasing demand for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). This pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, evaluated a novel model of ARV community delivery: lay health workers (home-based carers [HBCs]) deliver ARVs to the homes of patients who are clinically stable on ART, while nurses and physicians deliver standard facility-based care for patients who are clinically unstable. Specifically, the trial aimed to assess whether the ARV community delivery model performed at least equally well in averting virological failure as the standard of care (facility-based care for all ART patients). METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study took place from March 1, 2016, to October 27, 2017. All (48) healthcare facilities in Dar es Salaam that provided ART and had an affiliated team of public-sector HBCs were randomized 1:1 to either (i) ARV community delivery (intervention) or (ii) the standard of care (control). Our prespecified primary endpoint was the proportion of adult non-pregnant ART patients with virological failure at the end of the study period. The prespecified margin of non-inferiority was a risk ratio (RR) of 1.45. The mean follow-up period was 326 days. We obtained intent-to-treat (ITT) RRs using a log-binomial model adjusting standard errors for clustering at the level of the healthcare facility. A total of 2,172 patients were enrolled at intervention (1,163 patients) and control (1,009 patients) facilities. Of the 1,163 patients in the intervention arm, 516 (44.4%) were both clinically stable on ART and opted to receive ARVs in their homes or at another meeting point of their choosing in the community. At the end of the study period, 10.9% (95/872) of patients in the control arm and 9.7% (91/943) in the intervention arm were failing virologically. The ITT RR for virological failure demonstrated non-inferiority of the ARV community delivery model (RR 0.89 [1-sided 95% CI 0.00-1.18]). We observed no significant difference between study arms in self-reported patient healthcare expenditures over the last 6 months before study exit. Of those who received ARVs in the community, 97.2% (95% CI 94.7%-98.7%) reported being either \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the program. Other than loss to follow-up (18.9% in the intervention and 13.6% in the control arm), the main limitation of this trial was that substantial decongestion of healthcare facilities was not achieved, thus making the logic for our preregistered ITT approach (which includes those ineligible to receive ARVs at home in the intervention sample) less compelling. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an ARV community delivery model performed at least as well as the standard of care regarding the critical health indicator of virological failure. The intervention did not significantly reduce patient healthcare expenditures, but satisfaction with the program was high and it is likely to save patients time. Policy-makers should consider piloting, evaluating, and scaling more ambitious ARV community delivery programs that can reach higher proportions of ART patients.

On the other hand, peripheral biomarkers of the SNS activity are more consistent, showing increased 24h urinary or plasma catecholamines in PTSD patients compared to control individuals.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare and serious complication of biguanide treatment. It usually occurs when a precipitating disease induces an acute renal failure and an incidental overdose. Voluntary intoxication is rare. Bicarbonate hemodialysis (HD) is recommended to decrease metformin levels and correct acidosis but its optimal duration has not been determined. This study was designed to document the characteristics and prognostic factors of intentional and incidental metformin overdose and to determine the optimal duration of HD. DESIGN: Ten years retrospective analysis of patients admitted in intensive care unit for metformin-associated lactic acidosis. SETTING: Two intensive care units (50 beds) in a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and biological characteristics, organ failures, and sequential metformin levels during HD were recorded. Forty-two patients were included (13 voluntary intoxications and 29 incidental overdoses); 74% of patients were in acute renal failure and needed HD. No death was observed in intentional overdose patients compared with 48.3% mortality in incidental overdose patients. The factors significantly associated with mortality were logistic organ dysfunction system score, pH, plasma lactate, and prothrombin activity. By multivariate analysis, a prothrombin activity <50% was the only independent predictive factor of mortality (relative risk: 59.8; confidence limits: 6.3-568; p < 0.0001). Sequential measurements of metformin levels during HD were consistent with a bicompartmental elimination pattern. A cumulative HD duration of 15 hours was associated with the return of metformin level to the therapeutic normal range. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the outcome of MALA was uniformly favorable after intentional metformin overdose. The vital prognosis was mainly influenced by the occurrence of multiple organ dysfunctions, the best predictive factor of death being an acute liver dysfunction as assessed by PT activity. Prolonged HD was needed to correct metformin overdose.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Adult survivors of childhood cancer have been reported to have an increased risk of late sequels. A cluster of abnormalities that contribute to the metabolic syndrome may be expressed at a higher level and therefore result in an increased risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated a single-centre cohort of 500 adult survivors (228 females) of childhood cancer, median age 28 years (range 18-59 years) and median follow-up time 19 years (range 6-49 years). We measured total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Data from the epidemiological Monitoring van Risicofactoren en Gezondheid in Nederland (MORGEN) study were used to calculate standard deviation scores as normative values. RESULTS: The criteria of the metabolic syndrome were met in 13% of the total cohort. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) survivors treated with cranial irradiation had an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome compared with ALL survivors not treated with cranial irradiation (23% versus 7%, P = 0.011), probably determined by higher prevalence of overweight and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Adult survivors of childhood cancer, especially those treated with cranial irradiation, are at increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Management of severe traumatic brain injury has centered on continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring with intraparenchymal ICP monitors (IPM) or extracranial ventricular drains (EVD). Our hypothesis was that neurologic outcomes are unaffected by the type of ICP monitoring device. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed 377 adult patients with traumatic brain injury requiring ICP monitoring. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) 1 month after injury. Secondary outcomes included mortality, monitoring-related complications, and length of ICU and hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 253 patients managed with an IPM and 124 with an EVD. There was no difference in Glasgow Outcome Score (2.7 \u00b1 1.3 vs 2.5 \u00b1 1.3, p = 0.45), mortality (30.9% vs 32.2%, p = 0.82), and hospital length of stay (LOS) (15.6 \u00b1 12.4 days vs 16.4 \u00b1 10.7 days, p = 0.57). Device-related complications (11.9% vs 31.1%, p < 0.001), duration of ICP monitoring (3.8 \u00b1 2.6 days vs 7.3 \u00b1 5.6 days, p < 0.001), and ICU LOS (7.6 \u00b1 5.6 days vs 9.5 \u00b1 6.2 days, p = 0.004) were longer in the EVD group. Age, opening ICP, and size of midline shift were independent predictors for neurologic outcomes and mortality, when type and severity of brain injury, as well as overall injury severity were controlled for. Duration of ICP monitoring and opening ICP were independent predictors for hospital LOS and the former predicted prolonged ICU stay. Device-related complications were affected by type of device. CONCLUSIONS: Use of EVDs in adult traumatic brain injury patients is associated with prolonged ICP monitoring, ICU LOS, and more frequent device-related complications.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has of late emerged as a cause of community-acquired infections among immunocompetent adults without risk factors. Skin and soft tissue infections represent the majority of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) clinical presentations, whilst invasive and life-threatening illness like necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, osteomyelitis and sepsis syndrome are less common. Although more widely described in the pediatric age group, the occurrence of CA-MRSA osteomyelitis in adults is an uncommonly reported entity. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an invasive CA-MRSA infection in a 28 year-old previously healthy male, manifesting with bacteraemia, osteomyelitis of femur, pyomyositis and septic arthritis of the knee. Initially a preliminary diagnosis of osteosarcoma was suggested by imaging studies and patient underwent a bone biopsy. MRSA was subsequently isolated from blood cultures taken on day of admission, bone, tissue and pus cultures. Incision and drainage of abscess was performed and patient was treated with vancomycin, with fusidic acid added later. It took 6 months for the inflammatory markers to normalize, warranting 6-months of anti-MRSA therapy. Patient was a fervent deer hunter and we speculate that he acquired this infection from extensive direct contact with deer.Molecular characterization of this isolate showed that it belonged to multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST30 and exhibited the staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) type IV, staphylococcus protein A (spa) type t019, accessory gene regulator (agr) type III and dru type dt10m. This strain harbored Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) genes together with 3 other virulent genes; sei (enterotoxin), hlg (hemolysin) and fnbA (fibronectin binding protein). CONCLUSION: This case study alerts physicians that beyond the most commonly encountered skin and soft tissue infections, pvl positive CA-MRSA can lead to invasive life-threatening disease especially in an immunocompetent adult. Heightened alertness is needed for osteomyelitis of long bones in adults, as it is not uncommon for this disease to mimic primary bone malignancy. Cure is achievable with early appropriate antibiotics guided by inflammatory markers.",

        "a": "For patients awaiting renal transplantation, there is guideline consensus on the need for ischemia testing but no agreement on the frequency of repeat testing. Moreover, there are no data in this population evaluating changes in ischemia assessed with serial myocardial perfusion imaging. Consecutive patients (n\u2009=\u2009649) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were referred for cardiovascular risk stratification before renal transplantation between 2007 and 2013. Of these, 151 patients (54\u2009\u00b1\u20099 years) underwent 2 stress-rest technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) studies with CT attenuation correction in accordance with regional guidelines, which recommend repeat imaging in high-risk subjects who have not undergone renal transplantation within 3 years. An abnormal perfusion result was defined as a summed stress score \u22654. The median interval between imaging was 39 months. At baseline, 28% of patients (42/151) had abnormal SPECT perfusion, half with a fixed defect. Nine subjects (6%) underwent revascularization between SPECT studies after the baseline imaging demonstrated an ischemic perfusion defect size affecting \u226510% of the myocardium. On repeat imaging, 60% (25/42) had abnormal perfusion. In the 72% (109 of 151) with normal baseline SPECT perfusion, 19% (21/109) demonstrated new ischemia at follow-up and 3% (3/109) had an ischemic perfusion defect size \u226510%. The development of new-onset ischemia was associated with systolic hypertension (p\u2009=\u20090.015), serum phosphate (p\u2009=\u20090.043), and Agatston score (p\u2009=\u20090.002), but not diabetes (p\u2009=\u20090.12).

        "a": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is associated with structural brain changes, with considerable variation in the extent to which these cortical regions are influenced. We present a novel metric that summarises individual structural variation across the brain, while considering prior effect sizes, established via meta-analysis. We determine individual participant deviation from a within-sample-norm across structural MRI regions of interest (ROIs). For each participant, we weight the normalised deviation of each ROI by the effect size (Cohen's d) of the difference between SCZ/control for the corresponding ROI from the SCZ Enhancing Neuroimaging Genomics through Meta-Analysis working group. We generate a morphometric risk score (MRS) representing the average of these weighted deviations. We investigate if SCZ-MRS is elevated in a SCZ case/control sample (NCASE = 50; NCONTROL = 125), a replication sample (NCASE = 23; NCONTROL = 20) and a sample of asymptomatic young adults with extreme SCZ polygenic risk (NHIGH-SCZ-PRS = 95; NLOW-SCZ-PRS = 94). SCZ cases had higher SCZ-MRS than healthy controls in both samples (Study 1: \u03b2 = 0.62, P < 0.001; Study 2: \u03b2 = 0.81, P = 0.018). The high liability SCZ-PRS group also had a higher SCZ-MRS (Study 3: \u03b2 = 0.29, P = 0.044). Furthermore, the SCZ-MRS was uniquely associated with SCZ status, but not attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whereas an ADHD-MRS was linked to ADHD status, but not SCZ. This approach provides a promising solution when considering individual heterogeneity in SCZ-related brain alterations by identifying individual's patterns of structural brain-wide alterations.",

Despite decades of research and clinical advancement, approximately 1 in 10 newborns in the United States is born prematurely. These newborns account for approximately three-quarters of perinatal mortality and more than one half of long-term neonatal morbidity, at significant social and economic cost (1-3). Because preterm birth is the common endpoint for multiple pathophysiologic processes, detailed classification schemes for preterm birth phenotype and etiology have been proposed (4, 5). In general, approximately one half of preterm births follow spontaneous preterm labor, about a quarter follow preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the remaining quarter of preterm births are intentional, medically indicated by maternal or fetal complications. There are pronounced racial disparities in the preterm birth rate in the United States. The purpose of this document is to describe the risk factors, screening methods, and treatments for preventing spontaneous preterm birth, and to review the evidence supporting their roles in clinical practice. This Practice Bulletin has been updated to include information on increasing rates of preterm birth in the United States, disparities in preterm birth rates, and approaches to screening and prevention strategies for patients at risk for spontaneous preterm birth.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To assess all-cause mortality patients with dementia treated with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs). DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 58,412 patients diagnosed with dementia and registered in the Swedish Dementia Registry were included in the study. Of the study sample, 2526 of the patients were prescribed APDs. Of these, 602 patients were prescribed typical APDs and 1833 patients were prescribed atypical APDs. Ninety-one patients were prescribed both typical and atypical APDs. MEASUREMENTS: All-cause mortality based on Swedish Cause of Death Register. Adjusted hazard ratios of mortality were calculated according to class of APDs (typical or atypical) prescribed. Final models were adjusted for age at dementia diagnosis, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, living arrangement, and Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: In the adjusted models, use of APDs at the time of dementia diagnosis was associated with increased mortality risk in the total cohort (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.5). After stratifying for dementia types, increased mortality risks associated with APDs were found in patients with Alzheimer's disease, mixed dementia, unspecified dementia, and vascular dementia. Higher risk for mortality was found with typical APDs in patients with mixed and vascular dementia and with atypical APDs in patients with Alzheimer's disease, mixed, unspecified, and vascular dementia. Furthermore, in patients with Alzheimer's disease who had typical APDs, use lower risk of death emerged in comparison with patients with atypical APDs. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Both the use of atypical and typical APDs increased the risk of death in patients with dementia even after adjusting for differences in basic characteristics between groups. Although we cannot rule out the influence of residual confounding, these results would seem to add to studies suggesting caution in APD prescription for patients with dementia.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: The Ponseti Method has dramatically altered the management of clubfoot, with particular implications for limited-resource settings. We sought to describe outcomes of care and risk factors for sub-optimal results using the Ponseti Method in Haiti. METHODS: We conducted a records review of patients presenting from 2011-2015 to a CURE Clubfoot clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We report patient characteristics (demographics and clinical), treatment patterns (cast number/duration and tenotomy rates), and outcomes (relapse and complications). We compared treatment with benchmarks in high-income nations and used generalized linear models to identify risk factors for delayed presentation, increased number of casts, and relapse. RESULTS: Amongst 168 children, age at presentation ranged from 0 days (birth) to 4.4 years, 62% were male, 35% were born at home, 63% had bilateral disease, and 46% had idiopathic clubfeet. Prior treatment (RR 6.33, 95% CI 3.18-12.62) was associated with a higher risk of delayed presentation. Risk factors for requiring \u2265 10 casts included having a non-idiopathic diagnosis (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.08-4.83) and higher Pirani score (RR 2.78 per 0.5 increase, 95% CI 1.17-6.64). Female sex (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.34) and higher Pirani score (RR 1.09 per 0.5 increase, 95% CI 1.00-1.17) were risk factors for relapse. Compared to North American benchmarks, children presented later (median 4.1 wks [IQR 1.6-18.1] vs. 1 wk), with longer casting (12.5 wks [SD 9.8] vs. 7.1 wks), and higher relapse (43% vs. 22%). CONCLUSIONS: Higher Pirani score, prior treatment, non-idiopathic diagnosis, and female sex were associated with a higher risk of sub-optimal outcomes in this low-resource setting. Compared to high-income nations, serial casting began later, with longer duration and higher relapse. Identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes in a low-resource setting can guide counseling, program development, and resource allocation.",

This study examined the effect of a programme focused on the transition of newly anticoagulated patients from hospital to the community. DESIGN: Open-label randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Home-based follow-up of patients discharged from acute care hospital in southern Tasmania, Australia. SUBJECTS: A total of 128 patients initiated on warfarin in hospital and subsequently discharged to general practitioner (GP) care were enrolled in the study. Sixty were randomized to home monitoring (HM) and 68 received usual care (UC). INTERVENTIONS: HM patients received a home-visit by the project pharmacist and point-of-care international normalized ratio (INR) testing on alternate days on 4 occasions, with the initial visit two days after discharge. The UC group was solely managed by the GP and only received a visit 8 days after discharge to determine anticoagulant control. RESULTS: At discharge, 42% of the HM group and 45% of the UC group had a therapeutic INR. At day 8, 67% of the HM patients had a therapeutic INR, compared with 42% of UC patients (P < 0.002). In addition, 26% of UC patients had a high INR, compared with only 4% of HM patients. Bleeding events were assessed 3 months after discharge and occurred in 15% of HM patients, compared with 36% of the UC group (P < 0.01).

However, a diabetic patient's increased focus on diet and weight control,although necessary, can lead to disturbed eating habits, medical complications, and \"resistance\" to treatment. The term \"diabulimia\" refers to the eating disorder in which patients with T1DM take less insulinin order to control their weight. Currently there is no valid questionnaire in the Greek language for the detection of eating disorders in T1DM. This study examines the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), a questionnaire that assesses the risk of \"diabulimia\"in patients with T1DM. 100 outpatients with a T1DM diagnosis of over one year -71 women and 35users of a continuous insulin infusion pump- were asked to complete the DEPS-R questionnaire translated into Greek (0-80 score range, >20 indicating high risk of disorders) along with the EAT-26 (0-78 score range,>20 indicating high risk of pathological eating behaviours or eating disorder) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-\u0399\u0399) (0-63 score range, >14 indicating high risk of major depressive disorder). The Greek versionof the DEPS-R showed strong internal consistency and construct validity (Cronbach's alpha=0,89 in total,0,90 in females and 0,85 in males). Factorial analysis revealed 4 factors (diet, weight loss, insulin use and compensatory behaviors) accounting for 65.68% of the total variance (19.90%, 18.50%, 15.64% and 11.65%of the total variance respectively). In addition, 35% of the sample scored above 20 on the EAT-26, 26% rated above 14 on the BDI-II and 40% had a score above 20 on the DEPS-R, while the average score was 19.22. The sound psychometric properties of the DEPS-R scale were confirmed for a Greek sample with T1DM suggesting that it could be used as a reliable tool for the detection of diabulimia. In addition, we found that Greek patients with T1DM appear to have an increased risk of developing eating disorders and depression.",

Participants who presented with knee osteoarthritis at baseline were included. We assessed baseline patient parameters such as demographics, anamnesis and physical examination measurements. Pain outcome measure was assessed annually using a numeric rating scale. Different pain trajectories were defined by latent class growth analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate relative risk ratios. RESULTS: In total, 705 participants were included. Six distinct pain trajectories were identified with favourable and unfavourable courses. We found significant differences in baseline characteristics between the different pain trajectories, including BMI; symptom severity; and pain coping strategies. Higher BMI, lower education, presence of co-morbidities, higher activity limitation scores and joint space tenderness were more often associated with trajectories characterized by more pain at first presentation and pain progression. No association was found for baseline radiographic features. CONCLUSION: We defined six distinct pain trajectories in individuals with early symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Our results can help physicians identify those patients that require more frequent monitoring compared patients for whom a watch-and-wait policy seems justifiable.

Putative clinical and pathological prognostic variables were evaluated and hazard ratios estimated. Regression analysis was done to identify independent prognostic factors, and iterative analyses identified clinically-relevant risk categories with a minimum of residual prognostic variables. The significance of recognised pathological prognostic factors differed according to the overall risk category. An intermediate risk group comprising patients with pN1 disease as well those with pT3 disease solely on the basis of a depth of invasion (DOI) of more than 10 mm, was identified.

We included studies involving adult ED UGIB patients evaluating preendoscopic risk scores and excluded reviews, case reports, and animal studies. The composite outcome included 30-day mortality, recurrent bleeding, and need for intervention. In two phases (screening and full review), two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted patient-level data. The consensus data were used for analysis. We reported sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We identified 3,173 articles, of which 16 were included: three studied Glasgow Blatchford score (GBS); one studied clinical Rockall score (cRockall); two studied AIMS65; six compared GBS and cRockall; three compared GBS, a modification of the GBS, and cRockall; and one compared the GBS and AIMS65. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the GBS were 0.98 and 0.16, respectively; for the cRockall they were 0.93 and 0.24, respectively; and for the AIMS65 they were 0.79 and 0.61, respectively. The GBS with a cutoff point of 0 had a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.08. CONCLUSION: The GBS with a cutoff point of 0 was superior over other cutoff points and risk scores for identifying low-risk patients but had a very low specificity. None of the risk scores identified by our systematic review were robust and, hence, cannot be recommended for use in clinical practice. Future prospective studies are needed to develop robust new scores for use in ED patients with UGIB.",

        "a": "Incidence of bone metastases is very high in advanced prostate cancer patients. Bone metastases likely have a significant impact on functional status and quality of life, not only related to pain, but also to the relevant risk of skeletal-related events. A better understanding of mechanisms associated with bone metastatic disease secondary to prostate cancer and more specifically to the cross-talk between tumor cells and bone microenvironment in metastatic progression represented the background for the development of new effective bone-targeted therapies. Furthermore, a better knowledge of biological mechanisms driving disease progression led to significant advances in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, with the development and approval of new effective drugs. Aim of this review is to outline the physiopathology of bone metastases in prostate cancer and summarize the main results of clinical trials conducted with different drugs to control morbidity induced by skeletal metastases and bone disease progression. For each agent, therapeutic effect on bone metastases has been measured in terms of pain control and/or incidence of skeletal-related events, usually defined as a composite endpoint, including the need for local treatment (radiation therapy or surgery), spinal cord compression, pathological bone fractures. In details, data obtained with chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel), new generation hormonal agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide), radium-223, bone-targeted agents (zoledronic acid, denosumab) and with several experimental agents (cabozantinib, dasatinib, anti-endothelin and other agents) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer are reviewed.",

        "a": "Daith piercing is an ear piercing located at the crus of the helix, bilaterally. It is getting great consent on social media as alternative treatment in chronic migraine. No data about its efficacy and action are available in scientific literature so far. We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient suffering from refractory chronic migraine with medication-overuse, who substantially improved after bilateral ear daith piercing. His migraine was refractory to symptomatic as well as prophylactic therapies. He used to treat headaches with up to five symptomatic drugs per attack and had attempted several pharmacological preventive therapies, including Onabotulinumtoxin A. He also underwent detoxification treatments with intravenous steroids and diazepam, without durable benefit. At the time of daith piercing, the headache-related disability measures showed a HIT-6 score of 64, a MIDAS-score of 70, and a 11-point Box scale of 5. On his own free will, he decided to get a \"daith piercing.\" After that, he experienced a reduction of migraine attacks, which became very rare, and infrequent, less disabling episodes of tension-type headache (HIT-6 score of 56; MIDAS score of 27, 11-point Box scale of 3). Painkiller assumption has much decreased: he takes only one tablet of indomethacin 50\u2009mg to treat tensive headaches, about four times per month. Beyond a placebo effect, we can speculate a vagal modulation as the action mechanism of daith piercing: a nociceptive sensory stimulus applied to trigeminal and vagal areas of the ear can activate ear vagal afferents, which can modulate pain pathways by means of projections to the caudal trigeminal nucleus, to the locus coeruleus and to the nucleus raphe magnus. Currently, daith piercing cannot be recommended as migraine treatment because of the lack of scientific evidence, the unquantified rate of failure and the associated risks with insertion. However, given the increasing but anecdotal evidence, we think that the mechanism needs testing by means of a controlled clinical trial in a population of chronic migraineurs.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing number of studies exploring prevalence of depression among hypertensive patients in high income countries, limited data is available from low and middle income countries, particularly Nepal. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed (sub clinical) depression and associated risk factors among hypertensive patients attending a tertiary health care clinic in Nepal. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional study design, with 321 hypertensive patients attending the Out-Patient Department of a central hospital in Nepal. Blood measure was recorded via a mercury column sphygmomanometer. Depression levels were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-Ia (BDI) scale. Demographics and risk factors were assessed. RESULT: The proportion of participants with undiagnosed depression was 15%. Multivariable analyses demonstrated an increase in BDI scores with increased aging. Approximately a 1 point increase in the BDI score was observed for each additional decade of aging in hypertensive patients. Additional factors associated with increased risk of depression included being female (4.28 point BDI score increase), smoking (5.61 point BDI score increase), being hypertensive with no hypertensive medication (4.46 point BDI score increase) and being illiterate (4.46 point BDI score increase). CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with hypertension in outpatient settings in Nepal, demographic (age, sex, education), behavioural (smoking,) and adherence factors (anti-hypertensive medication) were associated with undiagnosed depression. Screening programs in Nepal may assist early intervention in hypertensive patients with sub clinical depression.",

We evaluated the association between sST2 and renal function and compared its prognostic value in HF patients with renal insufficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n\u00a0= 879; median age 70.4 years; 71.8% men) were divided into 3 subgroups according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n\u00a0= 337); 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n\u00a0= 352); and <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n\u00a0= 190). sST2 (rho\u00a0= -0.16; P\u00a0< .001), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (rho\u00a0= -0.40; P < .001), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (rho\u00a0= -0.47; P < .001) inversely correlated with eGFR. All-cause mortality was the primary end point. During a median follow-up of 3.46 years, 312 patients (35%) died, 246 of them from the subgroup of 542 patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (45%). Biomarker combination including sST2 showed best discrimination, calibration, and reclassification metrics in renal insufficiency patients (net reclassification improvement 16.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.1-25; P < .001]; integrated discrimination improvement 4.2 [95% CI 2.2-6.2; P < .001]). Improvement in reclassification was higher in these patients than in the total cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic value of sST2 was not influenced by renal function. On top of other biomarkers, sST2 improved long-term prediction in patients with renal insufficiency even more than in the total cohort.",

        "a": "Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is progressively colonizing humans and animals living with humans. During this process, hypervirulent strains and mutated toxin A and B of C. difficile (TcdA and TcdB) are originating and developing. While in healthy subjects colonization by C. difficile becomes a risk after the use of antibiotics that alter the microbiome, other categories of people are more susceptible to infection and at risk of relapse, such as those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent in vitro studies suggest that this increased susceptibility could be due to the strong cytotoxic synergism between TcdB and proinflammatory cytokines the tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (CKs). Therefore, in subjects with IBD the presence of an inflammatory state in the colon could be the driver that increases the susceptibility to C. difficile infection and its progression and relapses. TcdB is internalized in the cell via three receptors: chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4; poliovirus receptor-like 3; and Wnt receptor frizzled family. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 and Wnt receptor frizzled family are involved in cell death by apoptosis or necrosis depending on the concentration of TcdB and cell types, while poliovirus receptor-like 3 induces only necrosis. It is possible that cytokines could also induce a greater expression of receptors for TcdB that are more involved in necrosis than in apoptosis. Therefore, in subjects with IBD there are the conditions: (1) For greater susceptibility to C. difficile infection, such as the inflammatory state, and abnormalities of the microbiome and of the immune system; (2) for the enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of TcdB +Cks; and (3) for a greater expression of TcdB receptors stimulated by cytokines that induce cell death by necrosis rather than apoptosis. The only therapeutic approach currently possible in IBD patients is monitoring of C. difficile colonization for interventions aimed at reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma levels when the infection begins. The future perspective is to generate bacteriophages against C. difficile for targeted therapy.",

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of frailty in older patients who experience major trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15). A retrospective cohort review using the national trauma registry data (Trauma Audit and Research Network) and an institutional database was carried out on all patients aged 60 years or older with an ISS> 15 who were treated at the regional Major Trauma Centre from 2014 to 2017 following major trauma. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index (mFI). Outcomes assessed included mortality, complications, hospital stay, functional outcome and discharge destination. 819 patients were included in the study. The most common mechanism of injury was fall from a height less than 2m (57.4%). 412 (51.3%) patients had a low frailty score, 280 (35%) had an intermediate frailty score and 110 (14%) had high frailty score. Increased frailty was associated with increased mortality at discharge (18.7%, 14.6% and 26.4% for low, intermediate and high frailty groups) and at one year (26.2%, 35.2% and 51%, respectively). Other predictors of mortality included male sex, age >90 years and the occurrence of a serious complication. Increasing frailty was also associated with an increased risk of serious complications including unplanned intubation, infection and progressive renal failure, and discharge to a destination other than home. This is the first study that has delineated the impact of frailty in older patients who experience major trauma and provides important information for patients, their families and healthcare providers. Future studies should focus on identifying care pathways that counteract the impact of frailty in this setting.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate an overall outcome of AOD, Fontaine stage III and IV, and to correlate their outcome with score of MRF. METHODS: We enrolled a group of 136 patients (99 males and 37 females), with an average of 63.7 yrs and SD 12.2 all with AOD, Fontaine stage III and IV. We divided pts in three groups--pts on medicament treatment--MT group, pts for lower limb amputation--AMP group, and pts for vascular surgery.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Of 971 T2DM patients aged 14-93 years old in this study, 182 had ever smoked and 789 never smoked. Propensity score matching (PSM) reduced the confounding bias between groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed on matched data to evaluate coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk. In addition, the mediation analysis was conducted among smoking exposure, HDL-C, and CHD. Results: A total of 139 pairs of patients who had never and ever smoked were matched. Logistic regression analysis showed that compared with patients who never smoked, those who smoked\u2009>\u200920 cigarettes per day (CPD) had a higher risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-7.89). Additionally, after adjusting for age, sex, origin, occupation, smoking status, body mass index, waist circumference, and diabetes duration, the OR for CHD with >20 years of cumulative smoking (pack-years) was 2.21 (95% CI: 1.05-4.65). Furthermore, we observed a significant dose-response relationship between CPD and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P < 0.001). Moreover, the mediation analysis showed that the indirect effect mediated by HDL-C accounted for 86% (effect\u2009=\u20090.0187, 95% CI: 0.0100-0.0316). Conclusions: Smoking may be a risk factor for CHD in T2DM patients. T2DM patients should stop smoking or reduce the CPD to prevent the onset of CHD. Moreover, to prevent CHD complications, monitoring HDL-C levels in T2DM patients who smoke may be necessary.",

Out of the 62 CHD patients negative for serum anti-HCV and HCV RNA patients, only three (4.84%) were shown to have HCV RNA in their PBMCs implying the diagnosis of OCI; their viral load range was 1.24-4.15\u00a0IU/ml. All three OCI-proven patients gave no history of hepatic disease. In this study, we found that patients considered to be free of HCV can have HCV replicating in their PBMCs. This awareness points to the possibility of HCV being transmitted from apparently uninfected persons. A positive HCV RNA detection in PBMCs is dependable in determining OCI among high-risk subjects particularly when a liver biopsy is not an option. HCV transmission can occur through hemodialysis units signaling incorrect application of infection control measures in our Egyptian dialysis units. Additional studies on hemodialysis patients are necessary to realize the true magnitude of OCI among this patient group and to highlight the importance of incorporating HCV viral assays in PBMCs into the diagnostic algorithm.",

        "a": "Heart failure and increased arterial stiffness are associated with declining renal function. This longitudinal study was designed to assess whether the combination of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and the ratio of brachial pre-ejection period (bPEP) to brachial ejection time (bET) was independently associated with renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), stages 3-5. The baPWV and bPEP/bET values were measured using an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device in 186 patients who were classified into 4 groups according to the baPWV and bPEP/bET median values. Renal function change was determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. Rapid renal progression was defined as an eGFR slope less than -3\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) per 1.73\u2009m(2) per year. The renal endpoints were defined as commencement of dialysis or \ue2f625% decline in eGFR. Among the four study groups, the group with high baPWV and bPEP/bET values had the lowest eGFR slope (P\ue2fa0.042). Multivariate analysis revealed that this group was independently associated with rapid renal progression (odds ratio, 9.560; P=0.009) and progression to renal endpoints (hazard ratio, 2.587; P=0.039). Our findings show that a combination of high baPWV and bPEP/bET is associated with adverse renal outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. Screening CKD patients by baPWV and bPEP/bET during the same examination may help identify patients with an elevated risk for adverse renal outcomes.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Stroke is presently the first cause of brain death in France. In this context, the question of elective non-therapeutic ventilation and resuscitation arises, aiming at enabling the patients for whom a decision to stop all the therapeutics has been made to evolve towards brain death and organ donation. In 2010, the French society of intensive care has released guidelines regarding stroke management including strategy on this topic. The question has also been referred to the Ethics Committee of Nancy university hospital by a chief-nurse of our hospital and we report here its conclusions and propositions. METHOD: A workgroup was appointed and has tackled the major issues: the justification, the risks for the patient and the society, the expression of the patient's consent, the legality of this care benefiting only a third party, and the practical details. CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSITIONS: Elective intensive care following decision to stop any treatment after severe stroke seems to be justified with regard to public health as well as individual or collective ethics, providing the patient has expressed his/her consent or his/her non-opposition before stroke occurrence. In France there is no legal frame regulating this practice, no information of the general public, and a public debate has yet to be initiated. Regarding the practical details, a priori agreement of the organ procurement organisation, patient's consent, and approval of the consultant required by the law of April 22, 2005\u00a0relating to Patients' rights and to the end of life to rule out any conflict of interest, have to be checked before referring the patient to ICU. Advance directives drafting must be developed and their scope extended to organ donation and elective resuscitation. Therefore, fair information of the general public and clarity and transparency of the procedures are needed. The prolongation of the French moratorium on Maastricht III type non-heart beating organ donation - grounded on fears of possible conflicts on interest - seems obsolete with regard to the increasing respect of the patient's autonomy and to the risk of harmfulness entailed by elective resuscitation before death.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Family medicine practitioners (FMP) take care of a varied range of patients with undifferentiated conditions over a lifetime. Although it was incepted in Saudi Arabia in 1980, limited data exists on FMP. This paper explores what family physicians deem relevant. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among FMP in Saudi Arabia in 2018-2019 who responded to an online questionnaire that listed 20 activities usually done by FMP asking them to rate their meaningfulness on a 5-point Likert Scale, and select the top 3 they would like to spend the most and the least time on. Chi-square statistics were used to compare preference for time spent on these six activities by participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 415 survey participants, the majority were male (246) and had a Bachelor's degree (176). The management of risk conditions, follow-up of chronic illnesses and running preventive health clinics were listed as most meaningful. The majority wished to spend more time on managing health risks, handling daily common complaints and follow-up of chronic illnesses and less time on terminal care activities (46.8%), emergency care (32.3%) and addiction medicine (23.4%). Bachelor's degree holders wished to spend more time on emergency care compared to Diploma, Board-certified and Fellowship holders (63%, 21%, 10% and 5%, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The activities preferred by FMP align with prevailing disease epidemiology. Variations in preferences of 'managing emergencies' reflect the varied format of training. Training of FMP should be standardized and further studies investigate reasons for specific preferences.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult and is often missed in the elderly due to nonspecific and atypical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms able to rule out PE and validated in young adult patients may have reduced applicability in elderly patients, which increases the number of diagnostic tools use and costs. The aim of the present study was to analyze the reported clinical presentation of PE in patients aged 65 and more. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective and retrospective English language studies dealing with the clinical, instrumental and laboratory aspects of PE in patients more than 65 and published after January 1987 and indexed in MEDLINE using keywords as pulmonary embolism, elderly, old, venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the title, abstract or text, were reviewed. RESULTS: Dyspnea (range 59%-91.5%), tachypnea (46%-74%), tachycardia (29%-76%), and chest pain (26%-57%) represented the most common clinical symptoms and signs. Bed rest was the most frequent risk factor for VTE (15%-67%); deep vein thrombosis was detected in 15%-50% of cases. Sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, and ST-T abnormalities were the most frequent ECG findings. Abnormalities of chest X-ray varied (less than 50% in one-half of the studies and more than 70% in the other one-half). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxemia and mild hypocapnia as the main findings. D-Dimer was higher than cut-off in 100% of patients in 75% of studies. Clinical usefulness of D-Dimer measurement decreases with age, although the strategies based on D-Dimer seem to be cost-effective at least until 80 years. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations due to pooling data of heterogeneous studies, our review could contribute to the knowledge of the presentation of PE in the elderly with its diagnostic difficulties. A diagnostic strategy based on reviewed data is proposed.",

        "a": "Increasing evidence suggests that lipid variability may be a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, few studies have evaluated the association between lipid variability and renal outcomes in patients with moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess whether lipid variability is associated with progression to dialysis in patients with CKD stage 3-5, and to evaluate the risk factors of lipid variability. This longitudinal study enrolled 725 patients with CKD stage 3-5. Intra-individual lipid variability was defined as the standard deviations (SDs) of lipid levels. The renal end-point was defined as commencing dialysis. During a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years, 208 patients (28.7%) started dialysis. The patients with CKD stage 3 with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol SD (per 1 mg/dL; hazard ratio, 1.035; 95% confidence interval, 1.003 to 1.067; p = 0.003) were associated with an increased risk of progression to dialysis, however this association was not seen in the patients with CKD stage 4 or 5. Furthermore, in the patients with CKD stage 3, a high urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (p < 0.001) and the use of statins (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased LDL-cholesterol SD. Greater LDL-cholesterol variability was associated with an increased risk of progression to dialysis in patients with CKD stage 3, but not in those with CKD stage 4 or 5. These findings support the potential role of aggressive lipid control on clinical outcomes and highlight its importance in patients with CKD stage 3.",

It introduced the Gaming Hazard Assessment Scale-a multidimensional GD risk screening tool-and evaluated the dimension structure, reliability, and validity of the scale among 959 Chinese gamers. A three-level structure, consisting of 18 items scored from 0 to 54, ultimately indicated satisfactory reliability, good validity, and acceptable model fit. The scale will help large-scale initial screening and early identification of patients with a high risk of GD.

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by recurrent phases of central apneas during sleep alternating with a crescendo-decrescendo hyperventilation. This abnormal respiratory pattern is often observed in patients with severe congestive heart failure and associated with fragmentation of sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a relatively high mortality. Increased peripheral and central chemosensitivity, prolonged circulation time, and reduced blood gas buffering capacity are the major factors contributing to the pathology. However, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms are not clear yet. Respiratory stimulants, oxygen and continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP) might reduce the severity of Cheyne-Stokes respiration but have little effect on daytime sleepiness and cardiac function. There is only limited data supporting the assumption that intensive heart failure therapy has an effect on Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old male patient with dilative cardiomyopathy (NYHA IV) suffered excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 24 points). The patient was a heavy snorer with a normal body mass index. Treatment was initiated including ACE-inhibitors, beta-receptor blockers, diuretics and digoxin. The patient underwent sleep analysis with a Somno-Check system which demonstrated Cheyne-Stokes breathing (Respiratory Disturbance Index RDI: 40/h, lowest desaturation 76%) and body position dependent snoring. Oxygen therapy (21/min) had no effect on daytime sleepiness. Due to the cardiac condition, the patient was accepted for heart transplantation. Three weeks after transplantation sleep analysis was repeated and demonstrated a lack of evidence for periodic breathing (RDI 1/h, no desaturations below 90%), while snoring remained unchanged. Daytime sleepiness improved significantly (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 6 points). Three weeks after normalizing left ventricular function a complete recovery from severe Cheyne-Stokes respiration was observed. CONCLUSION: Adequate therapy of the underlying cause of Cheyne-Stokes breathing such as end-stage congestive heart failure might sufficiently abolish any breathing abnormalities.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a simple small vessel disease (SVD) score, which uses information available on rapid visual assessment of clinical MRI scans, predicts risk of cognitive decline and dementia, above that provided by simple clinical measures. METHODS: Three prospective longitudinal cohort studies (SCANS [St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke], RUN DMC [Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cohort], and the ASPS [Austrian Stroke Prevention Study]), which covered a range of SVD severity from mild and asymptomatic to severe and symptomatic, were included. In all studies, MRI was performed at baseline, cognitive tests repeated during follow-up, and progression to dementia recorded prospectively. Outcome measures were cognitive decline and onset of dementia during follow-up. We determined whether the SVD score predicted risk of cognitive decline and future dementia. We also determined whether using the score to select a group of patients with more severe disease would reduce sample sizes for clinical intervention trials. RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of all 3 cohorts, the score improved prediction of dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.89) compared with that from clinical risk factors alone (AUC, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71-0.81). Predictive performance was higher in patients with more severe SVD. Power calculations showed selecting patients with a higher score reduced sample sizes required for hypothetical clinical trials by 40%-66% depending on the outcome measure used. CONCLUSIONS: A simple SVD score, easily obtainable from clinical MRI scans and therefore applicable in routine clinical practice, aided prediction of future dementia risk.",

In the present study on patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), we correlated plasma OPG concentrations with severity of disease and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive inpatients (26 females; mean age 70 years (S.D.: 12), undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) because of advanced symptomatic PAD of the lower extremities were studied. Severity grade of disease (clinical stage after \"Fontaine\", functional measurements in terms of the ankle brachial index (ABI) and \"Bollinger score\" of angiographies), biochemical parameters and a detailed cardiovascular risk profile were documented. Fasting plasma concentrations of OPG were measured by a commercial sandwich enzyme immunoassay. MAIN RESULTS: The mean plasma concentrations of OPG were 5.3 pmol/l (S.D.: 3.3). Plasma OPG concentrations in subjects with PAD, clinical stages III-IV (n=15) were 7.9 pmol/l (S.D.: 5.3) and were significantly higher than in patients without ischemic ulcerations (n=52; 4.6 pmol/l; S.D.: 2.0; p<0.01). The mean value of Bollinger score was 29.1 (S.D.: 19.8). OPG was positively correlated with Bollinger score of disease (r=0.31; p<0.02), age (r=0.58; p<0.01) and creatinine-values (r=0.32; p<0.01) and negatively correlated with ABI (r=-0.39; p<0.03). CONCLUSION: In patients with PAD, plasma OPG concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with ischemic ulcerations than in those without and were positively correlated with higher severity grade of disease, age and creatinine-values. Further studies are required to analyze the role of OPG as a diagnostic marker for severity of atherosclerotic disease and to assess a possible therapeutic potential as \"vasculoprotegerin\".",

        "a": "Background: SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, continues to cause a worldwide pandemic, with more than 147 million being affected globally as of this writing. People's responses to COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to severe, and the disease is sometimes fatal. Its severity is affected by different factors and comorbidities of the infected patients. Living at a high altitude could be another factor that affects the severity of the disease in infected patients. Methods: In the present study, we have analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19-infected patients in Taif, a high-altitude region of Saudi Arabia. In addition, we compared matched diseased subjects to those living at sea level. We hypothesized that people living in high-altitude locations are prone to develop a more severe form of COVID-19 than those living at sea level. Results: Age and a high Charlson comorbidity score were associated with increased numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality among COVID-19 patients. These ICU admissions and fatalities were found mainly in patients with comorbidities. Rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, higher D-dimer, ferritin, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in ICU patients. CRP was the most independent of the laboratory biomarkers found to be potential predictors of death. COVID-19 patients who live at higher altitude developed a less severe form of the disease and had a lower mortality rate, in comparison to matched subjects living at sea level. Conclusion: CRP and Charlson comorbidity scores can be considered predictive of disease severity. People living at higher altitudes developed less severe forms of COVID-19 disease than those living at sea level, due to a not-yet-known mechanism.",

Recommended surveillance strategies for at-risk patients include ultrasound with or without \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), but their sensitivity is suboptimal. We sought to develop a novel, blood-based biomarker panel with improved sensitivity for early-stage HCC detection. METHODS: In a multicenter, case-control study, we collected blood specimens from patients with HCC and age-matched controls with underlying liver disease but without HCC. Ten previously reported methylated DNA markers (MDMs) associated with HCC, methylated B3GALT6 (reference DNA marker), and 3 candidate proteins, including AFP, were assayed and analyzed by a logistic regression algorithm to predict HCC cases. The accuracy of the multi-target HCC panel was compared with that of other blood-based biomarkers for HCC detection. RESULTS: The study included 135 HCC cases and 302 controls. We identified a multi-target HCC panel of 3 MDMs (HOXA1, EMX1, and TSPYL5), B3GALT6 and 2 protein markers (AFP and AFP-L3) with a higher sensitivity (71%, 95% CI: 60-81%) at 90% specificity for early-stage HCC than the GALAD score (41%, 95% CI: 30-53%) or AFP \u22657.32 ng/mL (45%, 95% CI: 33-57%). The AUC for the multi-target HCC panel for detecting any stage HCC was 0.92 compared with 0.87 for the GALAD score and 0.81 for AFP alone. The panel performed equally well in important subgroups based on liver disease etiology, presence of cirrhosis, or sex. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel, blood-based biomarker panel that demonstrates high sensitivity for early-stage HCC. These data support the potential for liquid biopsy detection of early-stage HCC to clinically benefit at-risk patients. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03628651).",

We sought to determine the clinical and economic impact of stress echocardiography (SEcho) when compared with exercise ECG (ExECG) in the assessment of these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following pre-test assessment by (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) TIMI score, patients were randomized to ExECG (n=218) or SEcho (n=215). Subsequently, low-risk patients were discharged; those considered high risk were referred for coronary angiography. Patients were followed-up for cardiac events and a cost-analysis performed. SEcho was superior to ExECG in stratifying patients as low risk (77 vs. 33%, respectively, P<0.0001) with no difference in cardiac event rate (5 vs. 3%, respectively). SEcho classified fewer patients as intermediate risk (3 vs. 39%, respectively, P<0.0001) and fewer patients required further tests when compared with ExECG (3 vs. 47%, respectively, P<0.0001). Costs for detection of coronary artery disease were significantly less in patients undergoing SEcho (pound366.63 vs. pound515.48, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: SEcho is superior to ExECG in the risk stratification of patients with suspected ACS but negative troponin. SEcho resulted in less diagnostic uncertainty, fewer referrals for further investigation, and hence, a significant cost benefit over ExECG.",

Mortality rates and indications were similar among trauma centers regardless of designation status. CONCLUSION: In a national population-based data set, the mortality after pediatric EDT is high, and many of these procedures are performed at nonpediatric trauma centers. Regardless of injury mechanism, EDT is not appropriate in children without signs of life on arrival. Pediatric guidelines are needed to increase awareness of the poor outcomes and limited indications for EDT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level IV.",

        "a": "AIMS: The incidence of anal squamous cell cancer (SCCA) is rising. Although chemoradiotherapy (CRT) provides a chance of cure, a proportion of patients have an incomplete response or develop recurrence. This study assessed the value of inflammation-based prognostic indicators, including the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in patients with SCCA treated by CRT with curative intent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed SCCA were identified from pathology records. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed and clinical, pathological and treatment characteristics were abstracted. The mGPS (0\u00a0=\u00a0normal C-reactive protein [CRP] and albumin, 1\u00a0=\u00a0CRP >10 mg/l and 2\u00a0=\u00a0CRP >10 mg/l and albumin <35 mg/l) and NLR were calculated from routine blood tests obtained prior to CRT. RESULTS: In total, 118 patients underwent CRT for SCCA between December 2007 and February 2018. Of these, 99 patients had appropriate pretreatment blood results available. Systemic inflammation as indicated by NLR >3 and mGPS >0 was present in 41% and 39% of patients, respectively. Most patients had T2 or larger tumours (n\u00a0=\u00a085, 86%) without nodal involvement (n\u00a0=\u00a064, 65%). An elevated mGPS was associated with more advanced T-stage (56% versus 35%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.036). NLR >5 was associated with nodal positivity (56% versus 31%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.047). On multivariate analysis, more advanced T-stage (odds ratio 7.49, 95% confidence interval 1.51-37.20, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and a raised mGPS (odds ratio 5.13, 95% confidence interval 1.25-21.14, P\u00a0=\u00a00.024) were independently related to incomplete CRT response. An elevated mGPS was prognostic of inferior survival (hazard ratio 3.09, 95% confidence interval 1.47-6.50, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 4.32, 95% confidence interval 1.54-12.15, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), independent of TNM stage. CONCLUSION: Systemic inflammation, as measured by the mGPS, is associated with an incomplete CRT response and is independently prognostic of inferior survival in patients with SCCA. The mGPS may offer a simple marker of inferior outcome that could be used to identify high-risk patients.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A large number of scoring systems have been proposed to define MOF, with no criterion standard. The purpose of this study was to compare three commonly used scores: the Denver Postinjury Multiple Organ Failure Score, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and the Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score, by descriptive analysis of the populations described by each score, and their predictive ability for mortality. METHODS: An observational cohort study was performed at a UK trauma center on major trauma patients requiring intensive care unit admission from 2003 to 2011. A novel trauma database was created, merging national audit data with local electronic monitoring systems. Data were collected on demographics, laboratory results, pharmacy, interventions, and hourly physiological monitoring. The primary outcome measure was mortality within 100 days from injury. Sensitivity analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive ability of MOF scores for mortality. RESULTS: In total, 491 patients were included in the trauma database. MOF incidence ranged from 22.8% (Denver) to 40.5% (Marshall) to 58.5% (SOFA). MOF definition did not affect timing of onset, but did alter duration and organ failure patterns. Overall mortality was 10.6%, with Denver MOF associated with the greatest increased risk of death (hazard ratio 3.87, 95% confidence interval, 2.24-6.66). No significant difference was observed in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values between scores. Marked differences were seen in relative predictors, with Denver showing highest specificity (81%) and SOFA highest sensitivity (73%) for mortality. CONCLUSION: The choice of MOF scoring system affects incidence, duration, organ dysfunction patterns, and mortality prediction. We would recommend use of the Denver score since it is simplest to calculate, identifies a high-risk group of patients, and has the strongest association with early trauma mortality.

        "t": "Clinical risk factor status in patients with vertebral fracture but normal bone mineral density.",
        "a": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Normal bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is present in approximately 10% of older adults with fracture. BMD alone does not evaluate bone quality or clinical risk factors, and therefore, may not adequately capture a patient's fracture risk. Thus, despite a normal DXA-measured BMD, the underlying bone may be abnormal, suggesting that further bone health evaluation, and potentially, pharmacologic treatment may be warranted. PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of normal BMD, clinical fracture risk factors, and quantitative risk of fracture using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) in vertebral fracture patients with normal BMD enrolled in the Own the Bone registry, thus facilitating identification of those who meet criteria for anti-osteoporosis therapy. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective, national registry-based cohort. PATIENT SAMPLE: From July 2016 to July 2021, 1,807 patients age \u226550 who sustained a vertebral fracture and had DXA data available from within 2 years prior to enrollment in the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone (AOA OTB) registry were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: World Health Organization (WHO) DXA T-score based bone classification criteria; FRAX risk scores of major osteoporotic fracture or hip fracture. METHODS: Demographic data, prior fracture site, and clinical fracture risk factors were collected. BMD status was classified by the WHO T-score criteria: \u2265 -1.0 normal, -1.1 to -2.4 osteopenia, and \u2264 -2.5 osteoporosis, with low bone mass including either osteopenia or osteoporosis. In normal BMD patients, FRAX scores were calculated with and without BMD, with the treatment threshold defined as a major osteoporotic fracture risk \u226520% or hip fracture risk \u22653%. RESULTS: Mean\u00b1SD age was 72.0\u00b19.7, 78.1% were female, and 92.4% were Caucasian. Normal BMD was present in 7.9%. Clinical fracture risk factors including alcohol use \u22653 units/day and history of \u22652 falls in the year prior to enrollment were more common in normal BMD (11.2% and 28%, respectively) compared to low bone mass patients (3.4% and 25.2%, respectively). A prior vertebral fracture had occurred in 49.5% with normal BMD compared to 45.8% with low bone mass, while a prior non-major osteoporotic fracture occurred in 28.9% and 29.3% of normal BMD and low bone mass patients, respectively. In normal BMD patients, either a prior fracture or FRAX risk with BMD meeting treatment thresholds was present in 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Clear indications for receipt of pharmacologic therapy, ie, prior fracture or elevated fracture risk, were present in most patients with vertebral fracture and normal BMD enrolled in the AOA OTB. Prior non-major osteoporotic fractures were common and may be useful indicators of underlying bone disease. Surgeons must recognize that other important risk factors apart from BMD may indicate poor bone health, and thus, help guide further bone health evaluation.",

Acute and chronic malnutrition have been associated with elevated risk of postsurgical wound complications, adding morbidity and cost to patients and their families. To study the association between demographic factors, including insurance type, race, and median neighborhood income (MNI), and malnutrition in patients with CLP. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed in patients undergoing their first cleft-related surgery at a large tertiary pediatric hospital from 2006 to 2018. Demographic data, weight and height at surgery, type of insurance, race, and primary residential address were collected. Geocoded information on MNI was generated using patient address. World Health Organization Z-scores for weight-for-age (WFA) and height-for-age (HFA) were used as proxies for acute and chronic malnutrition, respectively. Linear regression models were generated to analyze the relationship of insurance type, race, and MNI on WFA and HFA Z-scores. RESULTS: About 313 patients met inclusion criteria. Increasing MNI predicted increasing WFA Z-score (0.05 increase in WFA per $1,000 increase, P\u00a0=\u00a0.047) as well as HFA Z-score (0.09 increase in HFA per $1,000 increase, P\u00a0=\u00a0.011). The effect of MNI was not independently modified by race for either WFA (P\u00a0=\u00a0.841) nor HFA (P\u00a0=\u00a0.404). Race and insurance type did not predict WFA or HFA. CONCLUSIONS: Lower MNI is a significant independent risk factor for acute and chronic malnutrition in children with CLP. Combined with previous investigation linking malnutrition to surgical outcomes in this population, this offers a target area for intervention to improve patient outcomes.

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the difference between tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy and identify the risk factors associated with the need for tracheostomy after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (TCSCI). METHODS: The demographic and injury characteristics of 456 TCSCI patients, treated in the Xinqiao Hospital from 2010 to 2019, were retrospective analyzed. Patients were divided into the tracheostomy group (n\u00a0=\u00a063) and the non-tracheostomy group (n\u00a0=\u00a0393). Variables included were age, gender,smoking history, mechanism of injury, concomitant injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, the neurological level of injury, Cervical Spine Injury Severity Score (CSISS), surgery, and length of stay in ICU and hospital. SPSS 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis and ROC curve drawing. Chi-square analysis was applied to find out the difference of variables between the tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy groups. Univariate logistic regression analysis (ULRA) and multiple logistic regression analysis (MLRA) were used to identify risk factors for tracheostomy. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of these risk factors. RESULTS: Of 456 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 63 (13.8%) underwent tracheostomy. There were differences in age (\u03c72 =\u20096.615, P =\u20090.032), mechanism of injury (\u03c72 =\u20099.87, P =\u20090.036), concomitant injury (\u03c72 =\u20096.131, P =\u20090.013),ASIA Impairment Scale (\u03c72 =\u2009123.08, P <\u20090.01), the neurological level of injury (\u03c72 =\u200934.74, P <\u20090.01), and CSISS (\u03c72 =\u200919.612, P <\u20090.01) between the tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy groups. Smoking history, CSISS \u2265\u20097, AIS A and, NLI \u2265 C5 were identified as potential risk factors for tracheostomy by ULRA. Smoking history (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.960, 95% CI: 1.524-5.750, P =\u20090.001), CSISS \u2265\u20097 (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.599, 95% CI: 2.328-9.085, P =\u20090.000), AIS A (OR\u00a0=\u00a014.213, 95% CI: 6.720-30.060, P =\u20090.000) and NLI \u2265 C5 (OR\u00a0=\u00a08.312, 95% CI: 1.935-35.711, P =\u20090.004) as risk factors for tracheostomy were determined by MLRA. The AUC for the risk factors of tracheostomy after TCSCI was 0.858 (95% CI: 0.810-0.907). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking history, CSISS \u2265\u20097, AIS A and, NLI \u2265 C5 were identified as risk factors needing of tracheostomy in patients with TCSCI. These risk factors may be important to assist the clinical decision of tracheostomy.",

        "a": "AIMS: Using a large clinical multi-site prospective chronic heart failure registry, we sought to determine (i) implementation of guidelines over time and (ii) adjusted survival benefit there from. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical characteristics, mortality, and medication according to guidelines [guideline adherence index (GAI) for ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists] were compared for 1481 patients included from 1994 to 2000 and 1811 patients from 2001 to 2007. The co-morbidity corrected GAI significantly increased from 1994-2000 to 2001-07 (P < 0.001). Concomitantly, 1- and 3-year mortality decreased (14.1-4.8 and 29.5-10.9%, respectively, P < 0.001 each). No interaction with age or sex was noted (P = 0.06, P = 0.25, respectively), though age determined complete medication according to guidelines (P < 0.05). The GAI was a significant predictor of lower overall mortality (adjusted HR per 10% increase: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.97; P = 0.001), again independent from age or sex. Results were essentially unchanged after controlling for co-morbidities and other potential confounders. CONCLUSION: This study shows that increased use of medication according to guidelines might occur without interventions targeting medication use. It seems to be associated with a substantial improvement in survival. Even though causality cannot be proven, the findings underscore the importance of meticulous implementation of guidelines irrespective of age, sex, or co-morbidities.",

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of autograft versus allograft for primary PCLR. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE to locate studies (level of evidence I-III) comparing clinical outcomes of autograft versus allograft in patients undergoing primary PCLR with the conventional transtibial technique. Search terms used were \"posterior cruciate ligament,\" \"autograft,\" and \"allograft.\" Patients were evaluated based on graft failure rate, examination of knee laxity, and patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm, Tegner, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], and objective IKDC scores). RESULTS: Five studies (2 level II, 3 level III) were identified that met inclusion criteria, including a total of 132 patients undergoing PCLR with autograft (semitendinosus-gracilis or bone-patellar tendon-bone) and 110 patients with allograft (tibialis anterior, Achilles tendon, or bone-patellar tendon-bone). No patients experienced graft failure. Average anteroposterior (AP) knee laxity was significantly higher in allograft patients (3.8 mm) compared with autograft patients (3.1 mm) ( P < .01). Subjective IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores improved for both groups across studies, without a significant difference in improvement between groups except in one study, in which Lysholm scores improved to a significantly greater extent in the autograft group ( P < .01). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing primary PCLR with either autograft or allograft can be expected to experience improvement in clinical outcomes. Autograft patients experienced less AP knee laxity postoperatively, although the clinical significance of this is unclear and subjective outcomes improved substantially and to a similar degree in both groups.",

Methods: Patients who developed HM after receiving TIPS at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2013 to June 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. HM severity was quantified by clinical spasticity index (CSI) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of the lower extremity. Clinical manifestations were combined with grades \u2160-\u2163. HM patients were divided into drug treatment (group A) and flow restriction group (group B) according to different treatment methods. The changes in CSI and FMA of the lower extremity after treatment were statistically analyzed in the two groups. P<0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. Results: A total of 421 cases of cirrhosis who underwent TIPS were enrolled. Among them, 30 developed HM, with 22 in group A and 8 in group B. The incidence of HM after TIPS surgery was about 7.13%. After treatment, CSI was gradually increased and FMA of lower extremity was gradually decreased in group A, while vice-versa in group B. CSI in the two groups were differed significantly at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment (P<0.05), while the difference in FMA of the lower extremity was statistically significant at 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment (P<0.05). CSI was decreased and FMA of lower extremity was increased after treatment in patients with group A HM grade I. CSI, and FMA of lower extremity changes were statistically significant (P<0.05) when compared with patients with HM grades \u2161-\u2163. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly lower in group B than that in group A (P=0.034), but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, infection, MELD score and mortality. Conclusion: A reduced portacaval shunt can improve HM in patients with liver cirrhosis after TIPS, and drug therapy alone is effective for patients with early HM grade I.",

We aimed to examine the mortality benefit of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 DM and ACS, compared with non-metformin anti-diabetes agents users. METHODS: Data were extracted from the prospective nationwide ACS-DM Taiwan Society of Cardiology registry. Propensity score (PS) matching on baseline characteristics and treatment measures was performed for metformin versus non-metformin users. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality outcomes among the PS-matched cohort as the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for all pre-determined covariates and quintiles of the PS among the overall population were performed as the secondary analyses. RESULTS: Of 1157 patients with type 2 DM and ACS receiving anti-diabetes agents, 78 patients (6.7%) died over the 2-year follow-up period. After PS matching, 318 metformin users were matched with 318 non-metformin users. Metformin users had a lower all-cause mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.95) in the primary analysis. The survival benefit of metformin therapy was consistent in the secondary analyses (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.54 while adjusting for all pre-determined covariates, and aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19-0.59 while adjusting for quintiles of the PS).

Mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 underlie the vast majority of clinically diagnosed cases. The aims of this study were to characterize and compare the clinical and morphologic features of pAVMs between these two genotype groups.MethodsSixty-six patients with HHT and affected family members were included. Genotype, phenotypic data, and imaging were obtained from medical records. Morphologic features of pAVMs were analyzed using computed tomography angiography. HHT symptoms, pAVM imaging characteristics, frequency of procedural intervention, and HHT severity scores were compared between ENG and ACVRL1 genotype groups.ResultsENG mutation carriers were more likely than ACVRL1 mutation carriers to have pAVMs (P\u2009<\u20090.001) or multiple lesions (P\u2009=\u20090.03), and to undergo procedural intervention (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Additionally, pAVMs in ENG carriers were more likely to exhibit bilateral lung involvement and growth over time, although this did not reach statistical significance. The HHT severity score was significantly higher in ENG than in ACVRL1 (P\u2009=\u20090.02).ConclusionThe propensity and multiplicity of ENG-associated pAVMs may contribute to the higher disease severity in this genotype, as reflected by the HHT severity score and the frequency of interventional procedures.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests that half-dose thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism may provide similar efficacy with reduced bleeding risk compared with full-dose therapy, but comparative studies are lacking. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of half-dose versus full-dose alteplase for treatment of pulmonary embolism. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes in patients receiving half-dose (50\u2009mg) versus full-dose (100\u2009mg) alteplase for pulmonary embolism. We used propensity score matching and sensitivity analyses to address confounding and hospital-level clustering. SETTING: Data from 420 hospitals obtained from the Premier Healthcare Database between January 2010 and December 2014. SUBJECTS: Adult critically ill patients with acute pulmonary embolism treated with IV alteplase therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This study included 3,768 patients: 699 (18.6%) in the half-dose and 3,069 (81.4%) in the full-dose group. At baseline, patients receiving half-dose alteplase required vasopressor therapy (23.3% vs 39.4%; p < 0.01) and invasive ventilation (14.3% vs 28.5%; p < 0.01) less often, compared with full dose. After propensity matching (n = 548 per group), half-dose alteplase was associated with increased treatment escalation (53.8% vs 41.4%; p < 0.01), driven mostly by secondary thrombolysis (25.9% vs 7.3%; p < 0.01) and catheter thrombus fragmentation (14.2% vs 3.8%; p < 0.01). Hospital mortality was similar (13% vs 15%; p = 0.3). There was no difference in cerebral hemorrhage (0.5% vs 0.4%; p = 0.67), gastrointestinal bleeding (1.6% vs 1.6%; p = 0.99), acute blood loss anemia (6.9% vs 4.6%; p = 0.11), use of blood products (p > 0.05 for all), or documented fibrinolytic adverse events (2.6% vs 2.8%; p = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with full-dose alteplase, half-dose was associated with similar mortality and rates of major bleeding. Treatment escalation occurred more often in half-dose-treated patients. These results question whether half-dose alteplase provides similar efficacy with improved safety, and highlights the need for further study before use of half-dose alteplase therapy can be routinely recommended in patients with pulmonary embolism.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are frequently transferred to level 1 trauma centers (L1TC) if they have minor findings on a computerized tomographic scan of the head due to the absence of continuous neurosurgical coverage in community hospitals (CH). We hypothesized that such patients can be safely managed at community hospitals with a qualified Trauma team. METHODS: This is a multicentered Retrospective Cohort Study. Patients with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (defined as Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 13-15\u00a0at presentation) and with minor findings on head Computerized Tomography (CT) presenting at a L1TC or 4 Community Hospitals between March 1st, 2012 and February 28th, 2014 were included. All these community hospitals are Level III Trauma center with a well-organized trauma team. Minor CT findings were defined as 1) epidural hematoma<2\u00a0mm; 2) subarachnoid hemorrhage<2\u00a0mm; 3) subdural hematoma<4\u00a0mm; 4) intraparenchymal hemorrhage<5\u00a0mm; 5) minor pneumocephalus; or 6) linear or minimally depressed skull fracture. Our primary end point was the need for TBI specific interventions in 3 groups of patients: 1) direct admission to the L1TC (L1TC group), 2) those admitted at one of the 4 CH (CH group), and 3) those transferred from CH to L1TC (TRANSFER group). TBI-specific interventions were defined as intracranial pressure monitor (ICP) placement, hyperosmolar therapy, or neurosurgical operation. Our secondary aim was to demonstrate that these patients can be safely managed in Community Hospitals with qualified Trauma teams. We also sought to identify the clinical outcomes in these three groups of patients - in terms of mortality and complications. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were included - 39 CH, 64 L1TC and 88 TRANSFER. There was no difference among the groups in terms of TBI-specific interventions: one TRANSFER, four L1TC, and no CH patients required hyperosmolar therapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.277). None of the patients required placement of an intracranial pressure monitoring device (ICP) or a neurosurgical operation and complications and mortality rates were similar among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild TBI and minor findings on head CT can be safely managed at CH with qualified Trauma Teams. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management Study, Level IVhbv.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with both motoric (e.g., dyskinesias) and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Examples of the latter include Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorder (ICD), which are separate but related behavioral/psychiatric complications of treatment in PD. Dysregulation of volition characterizes both dyskinesias and DDS/ICD; thus, we analyzed potential disease-related correlates in a large PD cohort. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 654 participants collected through the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program. DDS/ICD symptoms and dyskinesias were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society (revised) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Potential associated variables were selected from PD-validated or PD-specific scales of neuropsychiatric or motoric status. Multivariable models with DDS/ICD or dyskinesia presence outcomes were produced with backward stepwise regression to identify factors independently associated with DDS/ICD and/or dyskinesias. RESULTS: Fifty-three (8.1%) participants endorsed DDS and/or ICD symptoms and 150 (22.9%) were dyskinetic. In multivariable analysis, psychosis was independently associated with both dyskinesias (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and DDS/ICD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Unpredictable motor fluctuations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) were also associated with DDS/ICD; female sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), low tremor score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and high akinesia-rigidity score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were associated with dyskinesias. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that psychosis may be an important marker of impaired volition across motor and cognitive domains. Unpredictable motor fluctuations, psychosis, and depression may together comprise a phenotypic profile of patients at increased risk for DDS/ICD. Similarly, dyskinetic PD patients should be closely monitored for psychotic symptoms and treated appropriately.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has taken on pandemic proportions with growing interest in prognostic factors. Overhydration is a risk factor for mortality in several medical conditions with its role in COVID-19, assessed with bioelectrical impedance (BI), gaining research interest. COVID-19 affects hydration status. The aim was to determine the hydration predictive role on 90 d survival COVID-19 and to compare BI assessments with traditional measures of hydration. METHODS: We studied 127 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Hydration status was estimated using a 50 kHz phase-sensitive BI and estimated, compared with clinical scores and laboratory markers to predict mortality. RESULTS: Non-surviving COVID-19 patients had significantly higher hydration 85.2% (76.9-89.3) vs. 73.7% (73.2-82.1) and extracellular water/total body water (ECW/TBW) 0.67 (0.59-0.75) vs. 0.54 (0.48-0.61) (p = 0.001, respectively), compared to surviving. Patients in the highest hydration tertile had increased mortality (p = 0.012), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (p = 0.027), COVID-19 SEIMC score (p = 0.003), and inflammation biomarkers [CRP/prealbumin (p = 0.011)]. Multivariate analysis revealed that hydration status was associated with increased mortality. HR was 2.967 (95%CI, 1.459-6.032, p &lt; 0.001) for hydration and 2.528 (95%CI, 1.664-3.843, p &lt; 0.001) for ECW/TBW, which were significantly greater than traditional measures: CRP/prealbumin 3.057(95%CI, 0.906-10.308, p = 0.072) or BUN/creatinine 1.861 (95%CI, 1.375-2.520, p &lt; 0.001). Hydration &gt; 76.15% or ECW/TBW &gt; 0.58 were the cut-off values predicting COVID-19 mortality with 81.3% and 93.8% sensitivity and 64 and 67.6% specificity, respectively. Hydration status offers a sensitive and specific prognostic test at admission, compared to established poor prognosis parameters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overhydration, indicated as high hydration (&gt;76.15%) and ECW/TBW (&gt;0.58), were significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality. These findings suggest that hydration evaluation with 50 kHz phase-sensitive BI measurements should be routinely included in the clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, to identify increased mortality risk patients and assist medical care.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death, morbidity and disability worldwide. Infection is a common complication in the acute phase after stroke. Herpes zoster is a common viral disease, in which the most debilitating complication is post-herpetic neuralgia, which can have a very large negative impact on quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether stroke increases the risk of herpes zoster. METHODS: This cohort study compared patients who had herpes zoster with and without a first incident of stroke. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was utilized to identify 20,551 stroke patients and 20,551 controls matched for age, gender, age categories and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score categories at a one-to-one ratio. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were employed to estimate herpes zoster risk in the stroke group relative to general population. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the stroke group had a greater risk for herpes zoster, especially within 1 year after stroke (adjust HR = 25.27). Both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were significantly associated with herpes zoster (hemorrhagic type (IRR = 2.31, 95% CI, 1.67-3.20); ischemic type (IRR = 2.51, 95% CI 2.09-3.02)). However, the hemorrhagic stroke patients had a higher risk of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (IRR = 12.46, 95% CI 4.00-38.76) whereas the ischemic stroke patients had a higher risk of post-herpetic neuralgia (IRR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.56-3.20). CONCLUSION: Physicians should know about that adults with stroke have a higher than normal risk of herpes zoster. Thus, physicians must be acquainted with proper antiviral therapy and pain control to bring down the morbidity that ensues from herpes zoster. Use of herpes zoster vaccine may be considered in stroke patients.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess 5-year outcomes of rSAGB compared with 5-year outcomes of primary SAGB (pSAGB). SETTING: University public hospital, France. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients who underwent SAGB between October 2006 and October 2008 were included in this retrospective study. rSAGB was defined as SAGB performed after failure of a first restrictive procedure. Five-year outcomes of each procedure regarding mortality, morbidity (i.e., Clavien-Dindo score), weight loss (change in body mass index [BMI] and percentage of excess BMI loss [%EBMIL]), co-morbidities remission, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) score, were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (24%) who had prior restrictive bariatric surgery (including 22 laparoscopic adjustable gastric bandings, 4 vertical banded gastroplasties, and 4 sleeve gastrectomies) underwent conversion to rSAGB. Ninety-six patients (76%) underwent primary SAGB (pSAGB group). Both groups were comparable in age, gender, BMI, and preoperative co-morbidities. Preoperative mean BMI of the rSAGB group was 45.5\u00b17 kg/m(2). There were no deaths and the major complications rate was 10%. No increase in morbidity was found between the 2 groups. Two patients required conversion to RYGB after rSAGB because of intractable biliary reflux. At 5 years, mean BMI was 32 kg/m(2) and mean %EBMIL was 66% after rSAGB; no significant differences were found compared with pSAGB (BMI = 31 kg/m(2), %EBMIL = 73%). Co-morbidities and remission rates were statically similar. Overall, GIQLI score was significantly lower in the rSAGB group (104.1\u00b117.6 versus 112.5\u00b116.8, P = .025). Significant differences were found in \"upper gastrointestinal symptoms\" and \"psychological\" scores. CONCLUSION: At 5 years, rSAGB for a failed restrictive procedure was safe and effective, but quality of life and upper gastrointestinal function were lower compared with pSAGB.",

Of the patients diagnosed with CAD, 40 (33.9%) had depressive moods, and 51 (43.2%) had anxious moods. A family history of CAD, low Korean activity scale index (KASI), and use of beta-blockers were independent factors causing depressive mood, while lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and low KASI score were independent factors causing anxious mood. A considerable number of patients (35.7% with depressive mood and 25.0% with anxious mood) still had emotional problems after 3 months of discharge.

Its prescription is with risks though which the recommendations regarding the scheduled dose are still based on very different criteria. METHODS: We performed a randomized, crossover pilot study. Six patients underwent six sessions of post-dilution hemodiafiltration with polysulfone HF80\u00ae dialyzer and standard anticoagulation with nadroparin, and six sessions with heparin-coated poliacrylonitrile AN69ST\u00ae membrane without using systemic anticoagulation. Dialyser and the extracorporeal circuit clotting grade was evaluated through visual scale every hour and coagulation parameters like anti-Xa factor. Our endpoint was to assess anti-Xa activity without differences in the rate of massive clotting between the two groups. RESULTS: No complete or grade 4 dialyzer clotting occurred in any of 36 sessions with each dialyzer. A partial lower 25% (grade 1-2) dialyzer clotting was in 32 (89.7%) AN69ST\u00ae sessions and 35 (97.2%) with the usual dialyzer and upper 25% (grade 3-4) in 4 (11.1%) AN69ST\u00ae sessions and 1 (2.8%) dialysis session with heparin. Arterial chamber blood coagulation was not greater than 25% (grade 3 and 4) in any of the studied sessions and the venous chamber in only 1 (2.8%) session with the usual dialyzer and 3 (8.4%) with no differences AN69ST\u00ae between the two dialyzers. The activated partial thromboplastin time at two hours showed differences between techniques related to administration of low molecular weight heparin (33.3 \u00b1 2.7s with polysulfone and 27.5 \u00b1 2.3s in AN69ST\u00ae; P < 0.05) which remained significant at the end of the session (29.8 \u00b1 2.1s with polysulfone and 27.2 \u00b1 1.8s with AN69ST\u00ae; P < 0.05). Anti-Xa factor activity was maximal two hours after administration of nadroparin, with differences between the two dialyzers (0.46 \u00b1 0.13 IU / ml in dialysis with polysulfone and 0.04 \u00b1 0.04 IU / ml with AN69ST\u00aep<0.005) and went down after 4 hours (0.17 \u00b1 0.12 IU / ml in dialysis with polysulfone and 0.02 \u00b1 0.03 IU / ml in AN69ST\u00ae; p<0.05). One patient in dialysis AN69ST\u00ae; had an adverse reaction characterized by generalized pruritus and was excluded from the study, by withdrawing the consent in the first session. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the low thrombogenicity of the AN69ST\u00ae; dialyzer that allows post-dilution hemodiafiltration sessions without systemic anticoagulation, and without increasing the frequency of severe clotting events compared to HF80\u00ae; dialyzer with nadroparin and with less risk of bleeding by not modifying the anti-Xa factor activity.",

        "a": "INTRODUCTION: Accommodation anomalies are frequently caused or exacerbated by psychological problems such as anxiety. Patients share many features with those with other anxiety based somatic symptoms such as stomach-ache, palpitations and headaches. They can be difficult to treat, and the ophthalmic literature rarely goes beyond diagnosis and ocular treatment. This study reports characteristics and outcomes of a short case series of patients with accommodation spasms and weaknesses assessed objectively, and outlines a psychological approach to treatment. METHODS: 23 patients (13 severe accommodative weakness or \"paralysis,\" 10 accommodative spasm) aged between 8-30\u2009years, were referred to our laboratory after diagnosis by their referring clinician and exclusion of pathology or drug-related causes. Their accommodation and convergence were assessed objectively with a laboratory photorefractive method, as well as by conventional orthoptic testing and dynamic retinoscopy. All interactions with the patients used an evidence-based psychological approach, to give them insight into how stress and anxiety can cause or exacerbate eye symptoms and help them to break a vicious cycle of anxiety and risk of deterioration. RESULTS: 83% were female and 57% had previously diagnosed anxiety or dyslexia (with many more acknowledging being \"worriers\"). Inconsistency of responses was the rule and all showed normal responses at some time during their visit. Responses were poorly related to the visual stimuli presented and objective responses often differed from subjective. Dissociation between convergence and accommodation was more common, compared to our large, previously reported, control groups. No participant had true paralysis of accommodation. Responses often improved dramatically within one session after discussion and explanation of the strong relationship between anxiety and accommodative anomalies. None have returned for further advice or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach explicitly addresses psychological factors in causing, or worsening, accommodation (and co-existing convergence) anomalies. Many of these patients do not realize that a certain amount of blur is normal in everyday life. Ocular symptoms are often a sign of anxiety, not the primary problem. By recognizing this, patients can be helped to address the triggering issues and symptoms often subside or resolve spontaneously. Well-meaning professionals, offering only ocular treatments, can deflect attention away from the real cause and can unwittingly be making things worse.",

METHODS: Patients with SSc that had undergone HRM between 1/2004 and 9/2014 were identified and HRMs were analyzed according to the Chicago Classification. Clinical characteristics were identified via retrospective chart review and compared among motility diagnoses while adjusting for age, gender, race, and SSc-disease duration. KEY RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (85% female, ages 25-77) were included. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with absent contractility (AC, n = 40), ineffective esophageal motility (IEM; n = 15), and normal motility (n = 19); the five remaining patients met criteria for other motility diagnoses. Groups differed in severity of skin involvement measured by the modified Rodnan skin score (0-51): AC (adjusted mean 12.6), IEM (4.4), normal (4.3), p = 0.043. Pulmonary function tests [percent predicted FVC and DLCO) were lower in AC (adjusted mean, FVC: 70.3, DLCO 51.1), than IEM (FVC: 92.0; DLCO: 76.9) and normal motility (FVC: 80.0; DLCO: 67.2), p values 0.057 (FVC) and 0.007 (DLCO). Groups did not differ by SSc-disease duration, autoantibodies, or reported symptoms of dysphagia or reflux. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In patients with SSc, absent esophageal contractility on HRM was associated with increased skin disease severity and worse lung function. Obtaining HRM to identify SSc patients with more severe esophageal dysfunction could be considered to enable implementation of management strategies in patients potentially at risk for increased morbidity and mortality.",

Next, using robust likelihood-based survival modeling, we developed a six-gene signature (CTSW, PCSK4, LRRC8D, TNFRSF18, IHH, and CDKN2A) with a prognostic function in UCEC. A prognostic risk score system was developed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression based on this six-gene signature. According to the Kaplan-Meier curve, patients in the high-risk group had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) outcomes than those in the low-risk group (log-rank test P-value <0.0001). This signature was further validated in the testing dataset and the entire TCGA dataset. In conclusion, we conducted an integrated study to develop a six-gene signature for the prognostic prediction of patients with UCEC. Our findings may provide novel biomarkers for prognosis and have significant implications in the understanding of therapeutic targets for UCEC.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health concern worldwide. There are limited studies which look into the actual knowledge level of CKD among the general population both locally and internationally. This study aims to assess the knowledge level of CKD among patients in a secondary hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: Consecutive sampling of patients attending the Medical Outpatient Clinic was performed in this crosssectional study. Respondents were given self-administered questionnaires which contain questions on demographic characteristics and knowledge on CKD. RESULTS: Out of 300 respondents, 78.6% (n=236) of the respondents completed the questionnaire. Majority of respondents (73.7%, n=174) scored less than 4 out of 7 marks on knowledge on CKD. Respondents who were younger, males, having higher education status, professionals/executives and earned higher monthly income were more likely to have a higher mean knowledge score of CKD. Respondents who have heard of CKD were also significantly associated with higher mean knowledge score of CKD. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that our Malaysian population is still inadequately informed on CKD, especially those who are at risk of developing CKD and its complications, and also among those of the lower socioeconomic group. In order for successful primary and secondary prevention of CKD, more importance should be placed on increasing awareness on CKD among these atrisk groups.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: HER2 and TOP2A parameters (gene status, mRNA and protein expression) have individually been associated with the outcome of patients treated with anthracyclines. The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic/predictive significance of the above parameters in early, high-risk breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin-based, dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: In a series of 352 breast carcinoma tissues from patients that had been post-operatively treated with epirubicin-CMF with or without paclitaxel, we assessed HER2 and TOP2A gene status (chromogenic in situ hybridization), mRNA expression (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), as well as HER2 and TopoIIa protein expression (immunohistochemistry). RESULTS: HER2 and TOP2A amplification did not share the same effects on their downstream molecules, with consistent patterns observed in HER2 mRNA and protein expression according to HER2 amplification (all parameters strongly inter-related, p values < 0.001), but inconsistent patterns in the case of TOP2A. TOP2A gene amplification (7% of all cases) was not related to TOP2A mRNA and TopoIIa protein expression, while TOP2A mRNA and TopoIIa protein were strongly related to each other (p < 0.001). Hence, TOP2A amplified tumors did not correspond to tumors with high TOP2A mRNA or TopoIIa protein expression, while the latter were characterized by high Ki67 scores (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis adjusted for nodal involvement, hormone receptor status, Ki67 score and HER2/TOP2A parameters revealed HER2/TOP2A co-amplification (21.2% of HER2 amplified tumors) as an independent favorable prognostic factor for DFS (HR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.96, p = 0.046); in contrast, increased HER2/TOP2A mRNA co-expression was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for both DFS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.31-4.42, p = 0.005) and OS (HR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.42-5.63, p = 0.003), while high TOP2A mRNA expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.23-3.46, p = 0.006). None of the parameters tested was associated with response to paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the favorable prognostic value of HER2/TOP2A co-amplification and the adverse prognostic value of high TOP2A mRNA expression extending it to the adjuvant treatment setting in early high-risk breast cancer. The strong adverse prognostic impact of high HER2/TOP2A mRNA co-expression needs further validation in studies designed to evaluate markers predictive for anthracyclines.

The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of the serum glucose/potassium ratio for predicting the prognosis of aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 565 patients with aneurysmal SAH between 2006 and 2016. The patient group comprised 208 men and 357 women (mean age 61.5 years, range 10-95 years). A statistical analysis was conducted of the clinical and laboratory risk factors of poor outcome, including the serum glucose/potassium ratio. RESULTS: On estimation of the initial assessment using Hunt and Kosnik (H-K) grading, 233 patients (41.2%) were classified as the severe SAH group (H-K Grade IV or V). There were significant correlations between the severe SAH group and serum glucose/potassium ratio (p < 0.0001). Serum glucose/potassium ratio was elevated in an H-K grade-dependent manner (Spearman's r = 0.5374, p < 0.0001). With the estimation of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge, 355 patients (62.8%) were classified as poor outcome (GOS score 1-3). The serum glucose/potassium ratio was elevated in a GOS score at discharge-dependent manner (Spearman's r = 0.4006, p < 0.0001), and was significantly elevated in the poor outcome group compared with the good outcome group (GOS score 4 or 5; p = 0.0245). There were significant correlations between poor outcome and serum glucose/potassium ratio (p < 0.0001), age (p < 0.0001), brain natriuretic peptide levels (p = 0.011), cerebral infarction due to vasospasm (p < 0.0001), and H-K grade (p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed significant correlations between poor outcome and serum glucose/potassium ratio (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the serum glucose/potassium ratio of patients with aneurysmal SAH at admission was significantly correlated with H-K grade and GOS score at discharge. Therefore, this ratio was useful for predicting prognosis of aneurysmal SAH, especially in severe cases.",

        "a": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and in 2002 it was expected that 636,000 new cases would occur in developed countries and 514,000 in developing countries. Although the incidence rate of this cancer in Asian countries is lower than in Western countries, whereas the incidence trend increasing rapidly in Asia. Using the data from the Cancer Registry System, this study was carried out to investigate the incidence trend during 2000-2005 in Iran and its six geographical areas. The incidence rates were standardized according to age-sex groups by Excel directly and confidence intervals is calculated for the point estimations by Stata11. The trends were analyzed separately based on gender, age groups for different provinces by Poisson regression in Stata11. The age standardized incidence rate in 2000 was 0.1 and 3.4 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively, reaching 0.5 and 16.7 per 100,000 in 2005. The incidence trends in all geographical areas of the country were increased despite the difference in the slopes. The sex ratio of male to female was 31.6 and the mean age of the patients was 49.4 (\u00b112.6) years. The incidence of breast cancer in Iran was lower than the European and Asian countries but the trend is in rising. Although this increase is due to the increase in the prevalence of risk factors among Iranian population. Improvement in the coverage of the cancer registry system as well as the screening programs are important factors for these changes.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Efforts to mitigate costs while improving surgical care quality have received much scrutiny. This includes the challenging issue of readmission subsequent to hospital discharge. Initiatives attempting to preclude readmission after surgery require planned and unified efforts extending throughout the perioperative continuum. Patient optimization prior to discharge, enhanced disease monitoring, and seamless coordination of care between hospitals and community providers is integral to this process. The perioperative surgical home (PSH) has been proposed as a model to improve the delivery of perioperative healthcare via patient-centered risk stratification strategies that emphasize value and evidence-based processes. RESULTS: This case report seeks to specifically describe implementation of readmission reduction strategies via a PSH paradigm during total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures at the University of California Irvine (UCI) Health. An orthopedic surgeon open to collaborate within a PSH paradigm for TJA procedures was recruited to UCI Health in October of 2012. Institution specific data was then prospectively collected for 2\u00a0years post implementation of the novel program. A total of 328 unilateral, elective primary TJA (120 hip, 208 knee) procedures were collectively performed. Demographic analysis reveals the following: mean age of 64\u2009\u00b1\u200912; BMI of 28.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2; ASA Score distribution of 0.3\u00a0% class 1, 23\u00a0% class 2, 72\u00a0% class 3, and 4.3\u00a0% class 4; and 62.5\u00a0% female patients. In all, a 30-day unplanned readmission rate of 2.1\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 0.4-3.8) was observed during the study period. As a limitation of this case report, this reported rate does not reflect readmissions that may have occurred at facilities outside UCI Health. CONCLUSIONS: As healthcare evolves to emphasize value over volume, it is integral to invest efforts in longitudinal patient outcomes including patient disposition subsequent to hospital discharge. As outlined by this case management report, the PSH provides an institution-led means to implement a series of care initiatives that optimize the important metric of readmission following TJA, potentially adding further value to patients, surgical colleagues, and health systems.",

        "a": "Introduction Acute pancreatitis is defined as inflammation of the pancreas. The body responds to inflammation by producing excessive neutrophils and causing programmed cell death of lymphocytes. This leads to immunological instability, which increases the severity of the disease and mortality rate. Recent data suggest that markers of systemic inflammation are able to predict the prognosis of various diseases. Our study aims to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis in conjunction with these hematological markers of systemic inflammation. Materials and methods Our study was carried out in the emergency medicine department of a tertiary care hospital among patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. It was\u00a0a retrospective study done by reviewing the hospital's medical records. Hematological indices such as hemoglobin levels, packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell (RBC)\u00a0count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet count, neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were observed to be associated with severity of pancreatitis. Those with computed tomography (CT) severity score >=7 were termed as severe pancreatitis, while those below 7 were considered mild to moderate. Results A total of 154 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of those patients was 48.47 \u00b1 16.71 years. There were 94 male and 60 female patients. There was no difference found among the study groups with respect to mean hemoglobin levels, RBC count, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, lymphocytes, and platelet counts. TLC (p<0.001), neutrophils (p<0.001), monocytes (p=0.008), NLR (p<0.001), and PLR (p=0.006) were found higher in severe pancreatitis, while LMR was found lower in severe pancreatitis (p=0.003). A linear relationship between the hematological indices and CT severity score has shown that TLC (p=0.015), neutrophils (p=0.005), NLR (p=0.001), and PLR (p<0.001) were positively correlated with severity while lymphocyte count (p=0.004) and LMR (p=0.005) were negatively correlated with severe pancreatitis. TLC and LMR were independent predictors of severe pancreatitis with an adjusted odds ratio of 12.80 and 5.47, respectively, on multivariable regression analysis. Conclusion Many markers correlated with the CT severity score, but few of them were able to demonstrate statistical significance on receiver operating characteristic\u00a0(ROC) analysis.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Digital remote patient monitoring can add value to virtual wards; this has become more apparent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinician's workload in the context of a COVID-19-specific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by objective and subjective cognitive deficits. Discrepancies between objective and subjective cognitive performance can reflect under- to over-estimations of cognitive abilities, and these discrepancies are referred to as cognitive self-appraisals. Despite evidence that low self-appraisals are associated with depression, the modifiability of self-appraisals and their association with treatment outcome remains unclear. The current study examined whether self-appraisals change following antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the association of self-appraisals with treatment outcome. METHODS: As part of the CAN-BIND-1 clinical trial, 154 patients with MDD completed measures of objective and subjective cognitive abilities, depressive symptoms, and functional outcomes (work productivity, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life) at baseline and post-escitalopram treatment. Self-appraisals were calculated based on discrepancies between objective and subjective cognitive abilities, with higher scores indicating overestimation of cognitive abilities. RESULTS: Baseline self-appraisals were not predictive of treatment outcomes. However, self-appraisals increased from pre- to post-treatment. Moreover, pre-post treatment increases in self-appraisals were associated with positive treatment response and remission, decreases in depressive symptoms, and improvements in work productivity, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. LIMITATIONS: The pre-post intervention design precluded examining the temporal precedence of change in self-appraisals versus depressive symptoms and functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are the first to demonstrate that self-appraisals are treatment-sensitive and are associated with treatment outcomes and recovery from MDD. Cognitive self-appraisals may represent a key marker of treatment response and a valuable target for assessment and intervention, as well as a potential mechanism underlying risk and recovery.",

        "a": "PURPOSE: To directly compare the clinical outcomes of aortobifemoral bypass surgery (ABF) and endovascular treatment (EVT) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (IAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we used an international database of 436 patients who underwent revascularization for CTO of the IAA between 2007 and 2017 at 30 Asian cardiovascular centers. After excluding 52 patients who underwent axillobifemoral bypass surgery, 384 patients (139 ABFs and 245 EVTs) were included in the analysis. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to compare clinical results in the periprocedural period and the long-term. RESULTS: Propensity score matching extracted 88 pairs. Procedure time (ABF; 288 [240-345] minutes vs EVT; 159 [100-205] minutes, p<0.001) and length of hospital stay (17 [12-23] days vs 5 [4-13] days, p<0.001) were significantly shorter in the EVT group than in the ABF group, while the proportions of procedural success (98.9% versus 96.6%, p=0.620), complications (9.1% versus 12.3%, p=0.550), and mortality (2.3% versus 3.8%, p=1.000) were not different between the groups. At 1 months, ABI significantly increased more in the ABF group for both in a limb with the lower (0.56 versus 0.50, p=0.018) and the higher (0.49 versus 0.34, p=0.001) baseline ABI, while the change of the Rutherford category was not significantly different between the groups (p=0.590). At 5 years, compared with the EVT group, the ABF group had significantly better primary patency (89.4\u00b14.3% versus 74.8\u00b14.3%, p=0.035) and survival rates (86.9\u00b14.5% versus 66.2\u00b17.5%, p=0.007). However, there was no significant difference between the groups for secondary patency (100.0%\u00b10.0% versus 93.5%\u00b13.9%, p=0.160) and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) (89.3\u00b14.3% vs 77.3\u00b17.3%, p=0.096). CONCLUSION: Even with recent advancements in EVT, primary patency was still significantly better for ABF in CTO of the IAA. However, there was no difference between the groups in terms of secondary patency and freedom from TLR at 5 years. Furthermore, there was no difference in procedural success, complications, mortality, and improvement in the Rutherford classification during the periprocedural period, with significantly shorter procedure time and hospital stay in the EVT group.",

RESULTS: Thirty-six studies involving 51.722 patients were included. Overall mortality for TCA was 96.2% and a favorable neurological outcome was seen in 43.5% of the survivors. Mortality rates were 97.2% in studies including prehospital deaths and 92.3% in studies excluding prehospital deaths. Favorable neurological outcome rates were 35.8% in studies including prehospital deaths and 49.5% in studies excluding prehospital deaths. Mortality rates were 97.6% if no physician was available at the prehospital scene and 93.9% if a physician was available. Favorable neurological outcome rates were 57.0% if a physician was available on scene and 38.0% if no physician was available. Only non-shockable rhythm was associated with a higher mortality (RR 1.12, p\u2009=\u20090.06). CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 20 patients with prehospital TCA will survive; about 40% of survivors have favorable neurological outcome.",

        "a": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming common in the United States and throughout the world and can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. There is a strong association between coronary artery disease and NAFLD due to common risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Subclinical atherosclerosis, defined as coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic patients, has been shown to have a higher incidence in patients with NAFLD. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the association of NAFLD with subclinical atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. Data were extracted from 12 studies selected using a predefined search strategy. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography scans. The rate of coronary artery calcification was analyzed using random effects models, and publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test. A total of 42,410 subjects were assessed, including 16,883 patients with NAFLD. Mean CAC score was significantly higher in subjects with NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD (odds ratio with random effects model, 1.64; 95% confidence inteval, 1.42-1.89). This association remained significant through subgroup analyses for studies with >1,000 subjects and a higher CAC score cutoff of >100. Higher aspartate aminotransferase levels were also associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis (mean difference 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.34). Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with NAFLD, where subclinical atherosclerosis is defined using a \"real world\" clinical biomarker, namely the CAC score. Prospective studies are needed to establish a causative link between NAFLD and coronary artery disease. (Hepatology Communications 2018; 00:000-000).",

        "a": "PURPOSE: To assess whether the risk of death is associated with the time to testosterone recovery (TTR) after radiotherapy (RT) and hormonal therapy (HT) for prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2001, 206 men with localized, unfavorable-risk PCa were randomized to receive RT or RT plus 6 months of HT. A multivariate postrandomization Cox regression analysis was used to assess whether the TTR in years was associated with the risk of death after adjusting for the known prognostic factors, age, Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 score, and the use of HT for recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 102 men randomized to receive RT and HT, 57 (56%) had a TTR of >2 years, and none of these men had died of PCa after a median follow-up of 7.6 years. As the TTR increased, the risk of death decreased significantly (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.84; p = .003). A significant interaction was noted between the TTR and the comorbidity score (p = .002). The survival estimates were similar (p = 0.17) across the TTR values in men with moderate to severe comorbidity; however, these estimates increased significantly (p < .001) with decreasing PCa-specific mortality (p = .006) as the TTR increased in men with no or minimal comorbidity. CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that a longer TTR after RT plus 6 months of HT for unfavorable-risk PCa is associated with a lower risk of death in men with no or minimal comorbidity.",

We tested our hypothesis that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and associated patient correlation factors might be increased (score < 26) according to the MoCA, in spite of a normal MMSE score, and that cognitive impairment might occur in a range of domains of the MoCA. Eighty-five patients participated in this study. The mean MoCA score was 22.44 (\u00b1 4.32). In spite of a normal MMSE score, which was an inclusion criterion, cognitive impairment was detected in 60% patients based on the MoCA score. The variable that correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment was the number of antiepileptic drugs (polytherapy: OR 2.71; CI 1.03-7.15). The mean scores of visuospatial and executive function, naming ability, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation among patients with mild cognitive impairment were significantly lower than those of patients with normal cognitive function. These findings suggest that mild cognitive impairment in cryptogenic epileptic patients is common. We suggest using MoCA as a screening test for patients with epilepsy.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is a mode of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients that has gained popularity all over the world. The authors reviewed one-year experience with CVVH in intensive care units (ICUs) of Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital. The objectives of this study were to describe the characteristics of the patients and demonstrate the association between various factors and outcome. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of 45 patients who underwent CVVH treatment were analyzed. All patients had been admitted into the ICUs of Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005. RESULTS: Average age of patients was 67.7 +/- 13.3 years (range from 27.0 years to 88.4 years). The male: female ratio was 1.4:1. Twenty-four patients were admitted to the medical ICU, 17 to the coronary care unit (CCU) and 4 to the surgical ICU. All of them needed mechanical ventilator support and 91.1% required vasopressor. Sixty percent of the patients had sepsis. Most of them had comorbidity including, cardiovascular (66.7%), hepatobilliary (35.6%) and neurological comorbidity (13.3%). Half of them had been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with pre-dialysis CKD in 40% and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in 11.1%. The mean number of organ failure was 3.18 +/- 0.1 and 95.6% had more than 2 organ failures. The range of APACHE II score was 15-50 (mean 30.8 +/- 9.5) with a predicted death rate of 21.0-97.8% (mean 66.4 +/- 23.4). The indications for renal replacement were 80% for level of nitrogenous waste product, 75.6% for volume overload, 42.2% for severe metabolic acidosis, 35.6% for hyperkalemia and 2.2% for toxic substance removal. Eighty percent of the patients had 2 or more indications. Mean blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) level before starting CVVH was 78.8 +/- 36.5 mg/dl (10.0 to 187.0) and 5.3 +/- 3.3 mg/dl (2.0 to 20.2) respectively. Duration of CVVH was 1.5 to 251.0 hours (mean 57.8 +/- 58.9) and the average CVVH dose was 36.6 +/- 7.5 ml/kg/hr (24.6 to 55.6). The overall mortality was 80%. The two most frequent causes of death were sepsis (44.4%) and cardiovascular disease (15.6%). The significant difference between the survival and nonsurvival groups were surgical ICU admission (p = 0.021), sepsis (p = 0.019), APACHE II score (p = 0.011), volume indication for CVVH (p = 0.028), number of dialysis indication (p = 0.019), duration of hospitalization (p = 0.004), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.012) and serum albumin level (p = 0.009). By logistic regression analysis, there was only statistical significance for serum albumin level less than 3 g/dl. CONCLUSION: One-year experience of CVVH in Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital showed high mortality rate but it is comparable to previous publications. The only factor that was associated with death by multivariate analysis was lower serum albumin level at the time of initiating CVVH. Prospective studies are required to explore this issue in the future.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Quantify association between the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide and risk of thyroid cancer (TC) compared to other antidiabetics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initiators of liraglutide, exenatide, metformin, pioglitazone or groups of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas were identified in a US health plan (2010-2014) and followed for a median of 17\u2009months. Thyroid cancer cases during follow-up were identified via a validated algorithm. Incidence rates of TC among liraglutide and comparators were assessed using relative risks estimated within propensity score-matched cohorts using intention to treat (ITT) and time on drug analyses. Latency effects and potential surveillance bias were evaluated. RESULTS: Relative risks from ITT analyses ranged from 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-1.79) versus metformin to 1.70 (95% CI 1.03-2.81) versus all comparators excluding exenatide. Effect estimates from latency analyses were slightly attenuated. Time on drug analyses suggested no increased risk for either longer duration or higher cumulative dose of liraglutide. Medical record review found 85% were papillary or a follicular variant of papillary or both; 46% were microcarcinomas (\u226410 millimeters), which were more prevalent in the liraglutide cohort (67% versus 43% in all comparators). CONCLUSION: Relative risks were elevated for several comparisons, which should be interpreted cautiously because of potential residual confounding and surveillance bias. Liraglutide cases had smaller thyroid nodules and shorter time-to-diagnosis, suggesting increased surveillance for TC among liraglutide initiators, especially shortly after the drug\u00b4s approval. After adjusting the primary analyses (ITT) for latency, no significant elevated risk of TC was observed among liraglutide initiators.",

        "a": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen implicated in a myriad of infections and a leading pathogen responsible for mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Horizontal transfers of genes among the microorganisms living within CF patients have led to highly virulent and multi-drug resistant strains such as the Liverpool epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa, namely the LESB58 strain that has the propensity to acquire virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Often these genes are acquired in large clusters, referred to as \"genomic islands (GIs).\" To decipher GIs and understand their contributions to the evolution of virulence and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa LESB58, we utilized a recursive segmentation and clustering procedure, presented here as a genome-mining tool, \"GEMINI.\" GEMINI was validated on experimentally verified islands in the LESB58 strain before examining its potential to decipher novel islands. Of the 6062 genes in P. aeruginosa LESB58, 596 genes were identified to be resident on 20 GIs of which 12 have not been previously reported. Comparative genomics provided evidence in support of our novel predictions. Furthermore, GEMINI unraveled the mosaic structure of islands that are composed of segments of likely different evolutionary origins, and demonstrated its ability to identify potential strain biomarkers. These newly found islands likely have contributed to the hyper-virulence and multidrug resistance of the Liverpool epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa.",

METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states. RESULTS: A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60\u2009years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] =\u20090.38-0.78) per 100,000 person-months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31\u2009days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00-2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.46-34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.22-10.65) for females compared to non-females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable. INTERPRETATION: Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.

Although it is a common procedure, there remain differences in surgical technique. Hospital administrative records in a public health care system were used to investigate the effect of patient, provider, and surgical factors on the risk of revision ACLR. PURPOSE: To define the rate and risk factors for ACL reoperation in Ontario, Canada, including both ipsilateral revision and contralateral primary procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: All primary elective ACLR procedures performed in Ontario (July 2003 to March 2008) in patients aged 15 to 60 years were identified via physician billing and hospital databases. Revision and contralateral ACLR were sought until January 2012. Patient factors (age, sex, comorbidity, income quintile, length of index hospital admission), provider factors (surgeon volume, academic hospital status), and surgical factors (allograft vs autograft; fixation type [screw, button, staple]; concomitant operative procedures) were used as covariates in a Cox proportional hazards survivorship model to generate hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) (\u03b1 = .05). Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves with ACL revision as the end point were generated. RESULTS: A total of 12,967 ACLR procedures with a mean follow-up of 5.2 years were eligible for study using preset criteria. The revision rate was 2.6% (mean \u00b1 SD, 2.91 \u00b1 1.71 years to revision). The rate of primary contralateral ACLR was 4.6% (mean, 2.95 \u00b1 1.81 years). In the Cox model, younger age (15-19 years) (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-2.9; P < .001), ACLR performed at an academic hospital (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1; P < .001), and the use of allograft (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P = .02) significantly increased the risk of revision ACLR. Only younger age (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7; P < .001) was associated with an increased risk of contralateral ACLR. CONCLUSION: Contralateral ACLR was more frequent than revision ACLR in this population, while both surgical procedures were most common in patients younger than 20 years. Academic hospital status, but not surgeon volume, as well as the use of allograft also increased the risk for revision ACLR.",

METHODS: Between 1999 and 2004, we performed CT screening for lung cancer on 4250 participants, all without documented prior cardiovascular disease, using multidetector-row (MD) CT. Of the patients, 1102 underwent imaging with a four-detector-row CT at 120 kVp and 40 mA, with pitch 1.5 and collimation of 2.5 mm in a single breath hold of 15-20 seconds, and 3148 did with an eight-detector-row CT at the same kVp, mA, and pitch settings but with collimation of 1.25 mm. Visualized CACs in each coronary artery (main, left anterior descending, circumflex, and right) were scored separately as 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe), yielding a possible score of 0-12 for each person. Frequency distributions by gender, age, and pack-years of smoking were determined. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression analysis of the prevalence of CAC as a joint function of gender, age, pack-years of smoking, and presence of diabetes. RESULTS: Among the subjects younger than 50 years, positive CAC scores were three times more frequent for men than for women (22% vs. 7%); among those older than 50 years, the frequency increased for both men and women but the increase for women was greater than that for men. The frequency of positive CAC scores increased with increasing pack-years of smoking; it was always higher for men than for women. The ORs were 2.6 for male gender (P<.0001), 3.7 and 9.6 for ages 60-69 years and 70 years or older, respectively, for increasing age (P<.0001 for both), 1.6 and 2.3 for 30-59 pack-years and 60 pack-years or longer, respectively, for increasing pack-years of smoking (P<.0001 for both), and 1.6 for having diabetes (P=.016). CONCLUSION: The CAC score can be derived from ungated low-dose MDCT images. This information can contribute to risk stratification and management of coronary artery disease.",

        "a": "Meningitis is a common and life-threatening infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in infants with long-term and disabling sequelae like hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is treated by diverting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) either to another body cavity (via CSF shunt) or externally (via CSF drain) which are prone to infection. Though rare, Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) is a known pathogen in device-associated CNS infections and has been reported in both, infants and adults. A six-month-old male infant was brought to the hospital with disproportionate head enlargement of three months duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was suggestive of gross asymmetrical hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed, and vancomycin and meropenem were started. Four weeks later, he developed a fever with a blocked EVD. Repeat MRI revealed gross asymmetric dilatation of left lateral ventricle along with pneumocephalus in the right periventricular region. A right temporoparietal craniotomy with drainage of a multiloculated abscess was done along with the removal of right EVD and placement of left EVD. CSF showed pan-susceptible C. parapsilosis and fluconazole was started. Despite treatment, CSF continued to grow C. parapsilosis through day 10. The EVD was removed, and an Ommaya reservoir along with the ventricular catheter was placed for better interventricular antibiotic administration. After day 13 CSF became sterile. Ommaya reservoir was removed, fluconazole was continued for three weeks, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed five weeks later. The device-associated CNS infections are insidious with nonspecific manifestations making diagnosis difficult. C. parapsilosis has been increasing in prevalence, especially in immunocompromised hosts, infants, and in patients with indwelling catheters. Amphotericin B or fluconazole is the usual treatment with excellent outcomes and no mortality. This case underscores the need for suspicion of C. parapsilosis as a cause of device-associated CNS infections.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand factors associated with refusal of adjuvant radiotherapy in endometrial cancer and its impact on outcomes. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Database for patients who underwent surgery for nonmetastatic endometrial cancer between 2004 and 2015 were pooled. The Pearson \u03c7 test and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess demographic, clinical, and treatment factors. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analyses and doubly-robust estimation with multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to analyze overall survival (OS). RESULTS: We identified 4739 of 80,803 patients (5.9%) who refused radiotherapy. Factors associated with refusal were: no insurance (relative risk [RR]=1.66, P<0.01), Medicare (RR=1.42, P<0.01), living >50 miles from treatment (RR=1.34, P<0.01), Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Scores of 1 (RR=1.16, P<0.01) or \u22652 RR=1.38, P<0.01), age above 60 years (RR=1.28, P<0.01), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IIIA (RR=1.63, P<0.01) and IIIC (RR=1.65, P<0.01) disease, papillary (RR=1.69, P<0.01) and clear cell histology (RR=1.64, P<0.01). Factors associated with radiation therapy receipt included: Hispanic race (RR=0.61, P<0.01), income >$63,000 (RR=0.89, P=0.044), undergoing chemotherapy (RR=0.17, P<0.01), FIGO stages IB (RR=0.81, P<0.01) and II (RR=0.70, P<0.01) disease, and lymphadenectomy (RR=0.79, P<0.01). After weighting, 5-year OS was significantly lower with refusal (74.3% vs. 79.7%, P<0.01). This survival decrement was maintained across FIGO stages. CONCLUSIONS: We identified characteristics associated with radiation refusal, including socioeconomic barriers, advanced disease stage, and histology. Refusal of radiotherapy conferred decreased OS across FIGO stages.",

        "a": "Introduction: As a unique feature of malignant tumors, abnormal metabolism can regulate the immune microenvironment of tumors. However, the role of metabolic lncRNAs in predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy of gastric cancer (GC)\u00a0has not been explored. Methods: We downloaded the metabolism-related genes from the GSEA website and identified the metabolic lncRNAs. Co-expression analysis and Lasso Cox regression analysis were utilized to construct the risk model. To value the reliability and sensitivity of the model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves were applied. The immune checkpoints, immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden of low- and high-risk groups were compared. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score was conducted to evaluate the response of GC patients to immunotherapy. Results: Twenty-three metabolic lncRNAs related to the prognosis of GC were obtained. Three cluster patterns based on metabolic lncRNAs could distinguish GC patients with different overall survival time (OS) effectively (p<0.05). The risk score model established by seven metabolic lncRNAs was verified as an independent prognostic indicator for predicting the OS of GC. The AUC value of the risk model was higher than TNM staging. The high-risk patients were accompanied by significantly increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules (including PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4) and increased tumor tolerant immune cells, but significantly decreased tumor mutation burden (TMB). Consistently, TIDE values of low-risk patients were significantly lower than that of high-risk patients. Discussion: The metabolic lncRNAs risk model can reliably and independently predict the prognosis of GC. The feature that simultaneously map the immune status of tumor microenvironment and TMB gives risk model great potential to serve as an indicator of immunotherapy.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the past, little attention has been paid to patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) who had minimal proteinuria upon the onset. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathological features and the prognostic factors in patients with IgA nephropathy. METHODS: Data of patients that had their first renal biopsy in our hospital and were diagnosed with primary IgAN with proteinuria <1 g/d from January 1995 to December 2014 were retrospectively examined. Clinical records of the clinicopathological features, renal function, and proteinuria were collected and investigated. The factors affecting the renal function and proteinuria were analyzed by Cox regression. The predictive efficiencies of clinical and pathological models were evaluated by Harrell concordance index (C-index). RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with IgA nephropathy were included in this study. (1) Baseline proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/d was positively associated with Oxford M, S, and T lesions. eGFR less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 were positively associated with Oxford T. (2) In the follow-up with a median of 50 months, 82 patients (16.2%) achieved complete clinical remission (CCR), whereas 54 patients (10.6%) showed an increase in creatinine by more than 50% (not progressing to end-stage renal disease). The cumulative proportion of creatinine increased >50%, and the values obtained by life-table analysis in 10, 15, and 20 years were 15%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Significant differences were found in baseline age, proteinuria, and Oxford T between the group of creatinine increase >50% and the CCR group. (4) Multivariate COX regression showed that baseline age and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d were independent risk factors of adverse outcome. C-index suggested that the clinical model was more effective than the pathological models in predicting endpoint events. (5) Effect of the mean value during the follow-up on adverse endpoint events: Multivariate COX regression found that the mean proteinuria during follow-up was an independent influencing factor for the increase of creatinine by more than 50%. CONCLUSION: (1) Proteinuria > 0.5g/d and eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 may predict more severe pathological changes; (2) With the increase in age and baseline proteinuria, the risks of adverse endpoint events would increase significantly; (3) Pathology could roughly predict the adverse endpoint events but is less efficient than the clinical indicators; (4) Data during follow-up suggested that the patients should regularly test their renal function and proactively control their proteinuria.",

        "a": "Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a severe disease and still has high mortality rate after conventional treatment (e.g., surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy). In NSCLC patients, cancer cells can induce immunosuppression, growth and metastasis by modulating cell adhesion molecules of both cancer cells and immune cells. Therefore, immunotherapy is increasingly concerned due to its promising anti-tumor effect and broader indication, which targets cell adhesion molecules to reverse the process. Among these therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (mainly anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4) are most successful and have been adapted as first or second line therapy in advanced NSCLC. However, drug resistance and immune-related adverse reactions restrict its further application. Further understanding of mechanism, adequate biomarkers and novel therapies are necessary to improve therapeutic effect and alleviate adverse effect.",

        "a": "BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) has become the standard of care for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, as atherosclerosis progresses with time on dialysis, it causes increasing difficulties in implanting the graft. This is a comparative study analyzing complications and graft survival of recipients with iliac revascularization before transplantation. METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2015, 1691 kidney transplants were performed at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed eighteen patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with the necessity of vascular revascularization before kidney transplantation to protect the inflow to the renal graft and to optimizing blood supply to the extremities. The primary endpoint included patient survival and graft survival. The secondary endpoints evaluate perioperative and early postoperative complication rates after kidney transplantation. RESULTS: All patients enrolled in this study underwent two consecutive surgical procedures. No patient reported limb loss, and there was no additional perioperative morbidity or mortality related to the vascular procedure. Primary endpoints such as graft survival without dialysis and overall patient survival show 1-month survival of 100%, 1-year survival of 94.1%, and 5-year survival of 84.70%, respectively. One graft failure occurred 8\u00a0months after transplantation due to acute rejection, and there were two deaths over follow-up period due to myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular repair before kidney transplantation is safe, and results are suggestive that it prolongs graft survival. These promising results should encourage other centers to address vascular repair before\u00a0the\u00a0transplantation to optimize blood supply to the extremity and the future graft. Although, the interpretation of our results must be cautiously because of the small and heterogeneous sample size, and the limitations of retrospective study design. Prospective trials with larger study populations are needed to confirm the results of this study and to identify significant differences.",

        "a": "Although patients having head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have high mortality, standardized prognostic tools are unavailable. As such, having a validated simple prognostic scoring system to help predict mortality in these high-risk patients is urgently needed. The current study aimed to develop and internally validate a prognostic scoring system for overall mortality in human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent HNSCC patients. Data on 400 consecutive patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas database with a known HPV-RNA negative status were analyzed. A prognostic model to predict patient overall mortality was developed using the logistic regression beta coefficients and a simple risk score was created. The model was internally validated using bootstrap validation with 2000 replications. Five covariates (age, pT, pN, perineural invasion, and EAp53 score) were used in the development of the mortality risk score in the final model. Three risk groups were stratified based on the prognostic scores: low-risk (<96 points), medium-risk (96-121 points), and high-risk (\u2265122 points) with a survival of 76%, 62% and 35%, respectively. The proposed model presented good discrimination in both the development (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI 0.70, 0.81) and bootstrap validation (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI 0.70, 0.81) with a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square of 6.17 (p = 0.63). The proposed prognostic scoring system is easy to use to predict patient overall mortality and could also help in the appropriate allocation of medical resources while managing HNSCC patients. External validation (including re-calibration if needed) should be conducted to test the model's generalizability in different populations.",

        "a": "The burden of cancer in ageing populations is causing great concern, particularly in Italy with Europe's fastest growing elderly population. Studying all cancers combined in one group, although of limited medical value, is of great interest from the viewpoints of public health, epidemiology and the economy. Using mortality data and an estimate of cancer patients' survival we have estimated and projected incidence and prevalence in Italy of all cancers combined in one group. Five major phenomena are highlighted in the paper: (1) the decrease in the age-adjusted cancer mortality rates among females and the stable mortality rates among males since 1990; (2) the changing pattern of cancer incidence since 1990, it has started to decrease for females and is stabilising for males; (3) the decrease in cancer incidence among males and females born after 1940; (4) the increase in the proportion of cancer patients that are cured with calendar years of diagnosis; (5) the increase in the total and the healthy life expectancy (i.e. cancer-free) among the Italian population since 1970. The declining and flat trends in age-adjusted cancer incidence and mortality rates since 1990 is the combined effect of survival improvements and cancer risk reduction for younger cohort groups, after 1940. These favourable trends contribute to the increase in healthy life expectation, thus supporting the idea that we live longer and healthier.",

        "a": "OBJECTIVE: This report presents the 30-day results of the Safety and Efficacy Study for Reverse Flow Used During Carotid Artery Stenting Procedure (ROADSTER) multicenter trial and evaluates the safety and efficacy of ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS (Silk Road Medical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), a novel transcarotid neuroprotection system that provides direct surgical common carotid access and cerebral embolic protection via high-rate flow reversal during carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS: A prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS during CAS procedures performed in patients considered to be at high risk for complications from carotid endarterectomy. Symptomatic patients with \u226550% stenosis and asymptomatic patients with \u226570% stenosis were eligible to be treated with any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved carotid artery stent. The primary end point was the composite of all stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death at 30\u00a0days postprocedure as defined in the Food and Drug Administration-approved study protocol. Secondary end points included cranial\u00a0nerve injury; 30-day stroke, death, stroke/death, and MI; acute device, technical, and procedural success; and access site complications. All major adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. RESULTS: Between November 2012 and July 2014, 208 patients were enrolled at 18 sites. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled as lead-in cases, and 141 were enrolled in the pivotal phase. In the pivotal cohort, 26% were symptomatic and 75% were asymptomatic. Acute device and technical success were 99% (140 of 141). By hierarchical analysis, the all-stroke rate in the pivotal group was 1.4% (2 of 141), stroke and death was 2.8% (4 of 141), and stroke, death and MI was 3.5% (5 of 141). One patient (0.7%) experienced postoperative hoarseness from potential Xth cranial nerve injury, which completely resolved at the 6-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial of CAS.",
