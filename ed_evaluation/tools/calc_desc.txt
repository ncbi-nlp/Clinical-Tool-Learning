1. Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC): Used to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with a low pre-test probability of PE without the need for further diagnostic imaging.
2. Ottawa Ankle Rules: Designed to minimize unnecessary radiographs in ankle and foot injuries. These rules help identify patients who are unlikely to have a fracture and therefore do not need an X-ray.
3. Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR): Aids in determining the need for cervical spine imaging in patients with trauma. It helps identify patients at risk of cervical spine injury.
4. Ottawa Knee Rules: Similar to the Ottawa Ankle Rules, these are used to determine the need for radiographs in knee injuries, aiming to reduce unnecessary imaging.
5. Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Assists in assessing the probability of DVT in patients with leg symptoms suggestive of this condition.
6. Wells' Score for Pulmonary Embolism: Helps in assessing the clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, guiding further testing and management.
7. Centor Criteria (Modified Centor Score): Used to estimate the probability of streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) and the need for antibiotics or throat cultures.
8. PECARN Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm: The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) provides guidelines to minimize CT scans in children with head trauma, reducing unnecessary radiation exposure.
9. CURB-65 Score: A tool used to assess the severity of pneumonia and guide decisions regarding the need for hospitalization.
10. HEART Score for Chest Pain Patients: Assists in the risk stratification of patients with chest pain, identifying those at higher risk of major adverse cardiac events.
11. CHADS₂ Score and CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score: These scores are used to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score is an extension of the CHADS₂ Score, incorporating additional risk factors to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
12. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): A neurological scale aimed at providing a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. It's used in head injuries and other neurological conditions.
13. The Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) is another important clinical decision rule used in emergency medicine, specifically designed to help clinicians decide when to use computed tomography (CT) imaging for patients who present with minor head injuries.
14. Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) Score: score is a simplified version of the SOFA score designed for use outside of intensive care units to promptly identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly from sepsis. Introduced by the Sepsis-3 guidelines, qSOFA is intended to be a rapid bedside tool to help clinicians identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a prolonged ICU stay or death.
15. Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS): A tool used to assess the risk of needing treatment for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The GBS includes variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, clinical signs, and lab results. It helps in identifying patients who may be safely managed as outpatients versus those who require inpatient care.
16. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) Criteria: Although somewhat superseded by the more recent qSOFA (quick SOFA) score for sepsis identification, SIRS criteria are still used in some contexts to identify patients who may be developing sepsis. SIRS includes parameters such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count.
